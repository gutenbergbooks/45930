<p class="center p4 title1">THE ROMANCE OF<br />
PLANT LIFE</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="small">THE ACTIVITY OF VEGETABLES</span></h2>

<p class="hanging">Plants which move&mdash;Sensitive Plant&mdash;A tourist from Neptune&mdash;The
World's and the British harvest&mdash;Working of green leaves&mdash;Power of
sunshine&mdash;Work done by an acre of plants&mdash;Coltsfoot, dandelion,
pansies, in sunshine and in cold&mdash;Woodsorrel and crocus&mdash;Foxglove&mdash;Leaves

and oaks requiring water&mdash;Traveller's tree&mdash;The water in
trees&mdash;An oasis in Greece&mdash;The associate life of its trees and flowers.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HEN we remember either the general appearance
or the way in which a cabbage or a turnip appears
to exist, it does not seem possible to call them
active. It is difficult to imagine anything less lively than
an ordinary vegetable. They seem to us the very model of
dullness, stupidity, and slowness; they cannot move even
from one field to the next; they are "fast rooted in the
soil"; "they languidly adjust their vapid vegetable loves"
like Tennyson's Oak.</p>

<p>In fact one usually speaks of vegetating when anybody is
living a particularly dull, unexciting kind of life in one
particular place.</p>

<p>And it even seems as if the books, which are supposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
give us the best information about the study of plants, and
which are not very attractive little books, quite agree with
the ordinary views of the subject.</p>

<p>For one finds in them that plants differ from animals in
being "incapable of motion." This, of course, just means
that an animal, or rather most animals, can walk, swim, or
fly about, whilst plants have roots and do not move from one
spot to another. But it is not true to say that plants cannot
move, for most plants grow, which means that they move,
and in some few cases, we find that plants behave very much
in the same way as animals do when they are touched or
excited in any way.</p>

<p>We shall have to speak about tendrils, roots, and insect-catching
plants later on. But it is perhaps the Sensitive
Plant which shows most distinctly that it can shrink back or
shrink together when it is bruised or roughly handled.</p>

<p>It will be described in its place, but just to show that
this plant can move of its own accord, it is only necessary
to hold a lighted or burning match about an inch or so below
the end of a long leaf. If one does this then all the little
leaflets begin to fold up, and finally the main stalk droops;
soon afterwards other leaves higher up the stalk begin to be
affected in the same way, and fall limply down one after the
other. It is supposed that this movement frightens a grazing
animal, who will imagine there is something uncanny about
the plant and leave it alone. There are many respects in
which this reaction of the Sensitive Plant resembles that
found in animals. It does not take place if the plant is
chloroformed or treated with ether; the leaves also get
"fatigued" if too often handled, and refuse to rise up again.</p>

<p>There are, however, only a very few plants in which an
immediate, visible answer to a stimulus can be detected. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
all plants are at work; they have periods of rest which
correspond to our sleep, but during their ordinary working
hours they never slacken off, but continue vigorously active.</p>

<p>The life of man is so short that it is difficult to realize all
that is being done by the world of plants. It is necessary to get
beyond our human ideas of time. That is most conveniently
done by considering how our plant world would strike an
inhabitant of the planet Neptune. Our theoretical Neptunian
would be accustomed to a year of 60,127 days (164 of our
years); we will suppose that three of our years are a Neptunian
week, and that ten of our days are about three-quarters
of a Neptunian hour, whilst two earth-hours would be a
minute to him.</p>

<p>If such a being were to observe our earth, he would be
astonished at the rapidity of our vegetable world. The buds
would seem to him to swell visibly; in the course of an hour
or two, the bare boughs of the trees would clothe themselves
with the luxuriant greenery of midsummer. Hops would
fly round and round their poles, climbing at the rate of a
foot a minute. Bare places, such as the gravel heaps near
a sandpit, or the bare railroad tracks at a siding, would be
perhaps in one week entirely covered by rich grass and wild
flowers. In six Neptunian months a forest of graceful
larches would spring up to a height of seventy or eighty feet.</p>

<p>So that, if one thinks Neptunially, the activity of plants
can be easily realized.</p>

<p>The truth is that we are so familiar with common annual
events, such as the regular harvest every year, that we never
seem to realize what it means. There are some 1,400,000,000
human beings on the earth to-day, and they entirely depend
on the work done every year by cultivated and wild plants.</p>

<p>Even in one of the least agricultural of all civilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
countries, such as Great Britain, the cultivation of plants is
still the largest national industry. In 1897 we grew enough
corn to give a ration of 1lb. per diem to every inhabitant
for 68 days, and we manage to get a large amount from
every acre (28 to 33 bushels per acre). In most other
countries the relative importance of land and of agriculture
generally is very much greater than it is in Britain.</p>

<p>Moreover, it seems at first sight as if all this harvest had
been made out of nothing at all. Plants do take in a small
amount of mineral matter from the earth, but these minerals
form but a very little part of the bulk of a tree or any
vegetable substance.</p>

<p>A piece of wood can be burnt up in a fire and very little
indeed of it is left. A few ashes will indeed remain, which
are the minerals taken in from the earth, but all the rest has
vanished into the atmosphere. The water which was contained
in the wood has become steam and is evaporated; the
woody matter consisted chiefly of compounds of a chemical
substance, carbon, which also becomes an invisible gas
(carbonic acid gas) in a fire and goes back into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>When the piece of wood was formed in a growing tree, it
is easy to see where the water came from: it was taken in by
the roots. Just as flowers drink up the water in a vase, and
wither if they do not receive enough, so all plants suck up
water by their roots. The carbonic acid gas is taken into
plants through their leaves and is worked up into sugar,
starch, wood, and other matters inside the plant.</p>

<p>But there is another very interesting point about the way
in which wood is burnt in a fire; heat and light are obtained
from a wood fire. Where did that heat and light come
from?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
If you walk in summer, under a tree in full leaf, it is
much cooler than it is in the sunshine outside. This shows
what happens: the sunshine has been taken up or absorbed
by the leaves of the tree. It does not pass through the
foliage, but the heat and light are stopped by the leaves.</p>

<p>The light and heat which were used up by the leaves in
making wood, sugar, and starch come back again when that
wood or starch is burnt.</p>

<p>So that the burning up of a bit of wood is just the
opposite to the formation of that wood in sunshine in a
living tree. The important point is that it is the sunshine
which is used by plants to make all these refractory bodies,
such as water, carbonic acid gas, and others, unite together
to form sugar, starch, and wood.</p>

<p>As the earth revolves upon its axis, sunlight falls successively
on every acre of land. Almost everywhere it is intercepted
by green foliage. Each leaf of every plant receives and
absorbs as much as it can, and, for so long as the light lasts,
its living particles are hard at work: water or sap is hurrying
up the stem and streaming out of the leaves as water
vapour. Carbonic acid gas also is hurrying into the leaves;
inside these latter first sugar and then starch is being manufactured,
so that the green cells become filled with starch
or sugar.</p>

<p>So soon as the light fails, the work begins to slacken. When
darkness sets in, the starch changes to sugar and passes down
the leaf-stalk into the stem, where it is used up in growth, in
the formation of new wood or in supplying the developing
flowers or young buds.</p>

<p>Next morning when the sunlight touches the plant all its
little living cells set to work again, and another day's task is
begun. It is very difficult to understand what is going on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
inside the leaf. If you were to imagine a square yard of
leaves all taking in sunshine and making starch as they do
in fine weather; then if you weighed all these leaves, and
then weighed them again one hour after they had been in
the sunshine, of course that square yard of leaf surface
should be heavier, because a certain amount of starch has
been formed in it. The amount actually made in one hour
has been estimated by Dr. Horace Brown as 1/500 lb. So
that 100 square yards of leaves working in sunshine for
five hours might make one pound of starch. But one can
estimate the activity of plants in another way. Look at the
amount of work done by the Grass, etc., on an acre of pasture
land in one year. This might entirely support a cow and
calf during the summer; all the work done by these
animals, as well as all the work which can be done on the
beef which they put on, is due to the activity of the grasses
on that acre. Moreover it is not only these large animals
that are supported, but every mouse, every bird, every
insect, and every worm which lives on that piece of ground,
derives all its energy from the activity of the plants
thereon.</p>

<p>All work which we do with our brains or muscles involves
the consumption of food which has been formed by plants
under the warm rays of the sun.</p>

<p>So that man's thoughts and labour, as well as that of every
living creature, is in the first instance rendered possible
by sunshine.</p>

<p>But the sunlight, besides this all-important function,
affects plants in other ways.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the early spring flowers is
the Coltsfoot. On bare blackish and unsightly heaps of
shale one may see quantities of its golden blossoms. Now if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
one looks at them on a fine sunny day, every single blossom
will be widely opened and each will turn towards the
sun.</p>

<p>In wet cold weather every blossom will hang its head and
be tightly closed up. Exactly the same may be observed
with the Dandelion, which is, indeed, still more sensitive
than the Coltsfoot. In cold wet weather it is so tightly
closed that it is barely possible to make out the yellow
colour of the flower, but on warm sunny days it opens wide:
every one of its florets drinks in as much as possible of the
genial sunshine. Both opening and closing are produced
by the warmth and light of the sun's rays.</p>

<p>It is also the same with Pansies. On a fine day they
spread out widely, but in cold wet weather the heads hang
over and the whole flower shrinks together.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of them all are the little
Woodsorrel and the Crocus.</p>

<p>Both are exceedingly sensitive to sunlight, or rather to the
cold. A mere cloud passing over the sun on a fine spring
morning will close up the flowers of the Crocus. In cold
weather, if you bring one of its flowers indoors and put it
near a bright light it will open widely, sometimes in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>What produces these changes? It is very difficult to say,
but every change helps towards the general good of the
plant. In warm sunny weather insects are flying about, and
they can enter the flower if it is open. These insects help
in setting the seed (as we shall see in another chapter). In
cold wet weather the flowers are best closed, as the rain might
injure the florets and because also no insects are abroad.</p>

<p>Both the Foxglove and the Blue Vetch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vicia Cracca</i>) are
specially ingenious in their way of obtaining light. For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
stalk of every separate blossom bends so that its head turns
to the best lighted or sunniest side. Thus, if you have
Foxgloves planted against a wall, every flower will turn
away from it; if you plant them in a circular bed, every
one turns to the outside, so that every flower can get the
sunlight.</p>

<p>Every one who has kept plants in a window knows that
the stems turn towards the light. This has the effect of
placing the leaves where they can get as much sunshine as
possible. The leaves themselves are also affected by sunlight.
They seem to stretch out in such a way that they
absorb as much of it as they can.</p>

<p>That, of course, is what they ought to do, for they want
to obtain as much as possible of the sunlight to carry on the
work of forming sugar and starch inside the leaf.</p>

<p>Not only each leaf by itself endeavours to place itself in
the best light-position, but all the leaves on the same spray
of, for instance, Elm, Lime, or Horsechestnut, arrange themselves
so that they interfere with one another as little as
possible.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Very little light is lost by escaping between the
leaves, and very few of the leaves are overshaded by their
neighbours on the same branch.</p>

<p>Thus all co-operate in sunlight-catching. But, when a
number of different plants are competing together to catch
the light on one square yard of ground, their leaves try
to overreach and get beyond their neighbours.</p>

<p>On such a square yard of ground, it is just the competition
amongst the plants, that makes it certain that every
gleam of light is used by one or other of them.</p>

<p>Every one of all those plants of itself alters the slope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
its leaves and turns its stems so as to get as much light as
possible.</p>

<p>This light, as we have seen, is taken in by the plant. It
is used to make the gas, carbonic acid,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> unite with water:
when these are made to join together, they form sugar; if
the sugar is burnt the heat and light appear again.</p>

<p>By changing the amount and arrangement of the molecules
in sugar, starch or vegetable fats, and many other substances
can be formed. But it is the sunlight that makes
all this possible.</p>

<p>Thus the sun not merely supplies the motive power for all
animal and vegetable activity but, by its influence, flowers,
leaves, and stems move and turn in such ways that they are
in the most convenient position to intercept its light.</p>

<p>The sunlight, though all-important in the life of most
plants, kills many kinds of bacteria and bacilli which love the
darkness. The well-known radium rays are also destructive
to bacteria, and hinder the growth of certain fungi (Becquerel's
rays have a similar effect). The X-rays are not so
well understood, but one can close the leaflets of the Sensitive
Plant by means of them.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas forms but a small proportion of the
atmosphere which surrounds a growing plant. Yet there
is no lack of it, for when the leaf is at work forming
sugar the particles of gas are rushing into the leaf, and
other particles come from elsewhere to take their place.
Every fire and every breath given off by an animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
yields up carbonic acid, so that it is constantly in circulation.</p>

<p>This is more easily seen by tracing the probable history
of an atom of carbon. We will suppose that it enters
a grass leaf as carbonic acid gas and becomes starch:
next evening it will become sugar and may pass from cell to
cell up the stem to where the fruit or grain is ripening. It
will be stored up as starch in the grain. This grass will
become hay and in due course be eaten by a bullock. The
starch is changed and may be stored up in the fat of the
animal's body. When this is eaten at somebody's dinner,
the fat will most probably be consumed or broken up; this
breaking up may be compared to a fire, for heat is given off,
and the heat in this case will keep up the body-temperature
of the person. The carbon atom will again become carbonic
acid gas, for it will take part of the oxygen breathed in, and
be returned to the atmosphere as carbonic acid gas when the
person is breathing.</p>

<p>Another atom of carbon might enter the leaves of a tree:
it will be sent down as sugar into the trunk and perhaps
stored up as vegetable fat for the winter. Next spring the
vegetable fat becomes starch and then sugar: as sugar it will
go to assist in forming woody material. It may remain as
wood for a very long time, possibly 150 to 200 years: then
the tree falls and its wood begins to decay.</p>

<p>The bark begins to break and split because beetles and
woodlice and centipedes are burrowing between the bark and
the wood. Soon a very minute spore of a fungus will somehow
be carried inside the bark, very likely sticking to the
legs of a beetle. This will germinate and begin to give out
dissolving ferments which, with the aid of bacteria, attack
the wood. Our carbon atom is probably absorbed into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
fungus. Very soon the mushroom-like heads of this fungus
begin to swell and elongate; they burst through the bark
and form a clump of reddish-yellow Paddock-stools. A fly
comes to the fungus and lays an egg in it. This egg
becomes a fat, unpleasant little maggot which eats the fungus,
and amongst others devours our carbon atom, which
again becomes fat in its body. Then a tomtit or other
small bird comes along and eats the maggot. That bird
stays out too late one evening and is eaten by an owl. The
owl, satisfied with a good meal, allows itself to be surprised
and shot by a keeper. When its body is nailed to a door
and decays away, the carbon atom again takes up oxygen
and becomes carbonic acid gas, which escapes into the atmosphere,
and is ready for a fresh series of adventures.</p>

<p>We must now consider the water which with carbonic acid
gas makes up sugar, etc. All plants contain a large percentage
of water. This may be as much as 95 to 98 per
cent in water plants, and 50 to 70 per cent. in ordinary
tissues; it is contained in every sort of vegetable substance.</p>

<p>But there is also a stream of water or sap which is almost
always entering the roots, rising up the stem, and passing
into the leaves. On these leaves there are hundreds of
minute openings called stomata, by which the water escapes
as water-vapour into the atmosphere. A single oak leaf may
have 2,000,000 of these stomata.</p>

<p>It is this current of sap which keeps the leaf fresh and
vigorous; it is also by this current that every living cell is
supplied with water and kept in a strong, healthy condition.</p>

<p>The amount of water used in this way is very great; in
four months an acre of cabbages will transpire or give out
through its leaves 3,500,000 pints of water and an
acre of hops from 5-1/2 to 7 millions. A single oak tree,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
supposed to have 700,000 leaves, must apparently have given
off into the atmosphere during five months 230,000 lb. of
water.</p>

<p>Sometimes the water is so abundant in the plant that it
collects as drops on the tips of the leaves and falls off as
fluid water. A very young greenhouse plant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caladium
nymphaefolium</i>) was found by Molisch to give off 190 water-drops
a minute, and in one night it exuded one-seventeenth
of a pint.</p>

<p>The water is found stored up in the stems or leaves of
plants, especially those of hot or dry climates. The Madagascar
Traveller's Tree, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ravenala</i>, has a considerable amount
of water in a hollow at the base of its leaf, and it is possible
to drink this water. The usual story is to the effect that
a panting traveller finds this palm in the middle of the
desert, and saves his life by quenching his thirst with its
crystal-clear water. Unfortunately the tree never grows far
from marshy ground or springs, and the water, which I tasted
for curiosity, had an unpleasant vegetable taste, with
reminiscences of bygone insect life.</p>

<p>These are, of course, exceptional cases; as a rule the tiny
root-hairs search and explore the soil; the sap or ascending
current passes up the stem and pours out into the atmosphere.
There the vapour is hurried off by winds, and
eventually condenses and, falling as snow or rain on the earth,
again sinks down into the soil.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to understand how the sap or water rises
in the trunks of tall trees; we know that along the path of
the sap inside, the root-hairs and other cells in the root, the
various cells in the stem, and finally those of the leaf, are all
kept supplied and distended or swollen out with water. All
these living cells seem to have the power of absorbing or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
sucking in water,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and eventually they are so full and distended
within, that the internal pressure becomes almost
incredible. Wieler found in the young wood of a Scotch fir
that the pressure was sixteen atmospheres, or 240 lb. to the
square inch. Dixon, when experimenting with leaf-cells,
found ten, twenty, or even thirty atmospheres (150 to
450 lb. to the square inch). No locomotive engine has
cylinders strong enough to resist such internal pressures as
these. It is an extraordinary fact, and one almost incredible,
that the cells can stand such pressures.</p>

<p>This and such palms are often placed at the mouths of cañons to indicate water, and
may, indeed, thus save the lives of passing travellers.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Yet these minute living cells not only exist but work at
this high tension, and, in some cases, they live to about
fifty years.</p>

<p>In this favoured country of Great Britain, it is unusual to
find any serious lack of water. But in Italy or Greece, every
drop of it is valuable and carefully husbanded.</p>

<p>Sometimes in such arid dry countries, a small spring of
water will form around itself a refreshing oasis of greenery
surrounded everywhere by dreary thorn-scrub or monotonous
sand. All the plants in such a spot have their own special
work to do: the graceful trees which shade the spring, the
green mosses on the stones, the fresh grass and bright flowers
or waving reeds, are all associated in a common work. They
protect and shelter each other; their dead leaves are used to
form soil; their roots explore and break up the ground. It
is true that they are competing with one another for water
and for light, but they are all forming a mutual protection,
and producing an annual harvest.</p>

<p>In a climate like our own we cannot, like the Greek,
suppose a Nymph in the shape of a lovely young woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
watching over the spring, for she would infallibly suffer
from rheumatism and ague.</p>

<p>But every living cell in every plant in such an oasis
depends upon the water of the spring. All the plants there
form an association which can be quite well compared to a
city or some other association of human beings. They do
compete, for they struggle to do the most work for the good
of the community, and they incidentally obtain their livelihood
in the process.</p>

<p>Most plant societies or associations such as those which
cover Great Britain are not so obviously dependent on one
particular spring, but the plants composing them are associated
in a very similar way.</p>

<span class="small">ON SAVAGES, DOCTORS, AND PLANTS</span></h2>

<p class="hanging">Savages knew Botany&mdash;First lady doctors and botanical excursions&mdash;True

book&mdash;Numbers of plants known&mdash;Discoveries of painters
and poets.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F we look back to the time when all men and women were
mere savages, living like the Esquimaux or the Australians
of to-day, then it is certain that every person was much
interested in plants. Nothing was so interesting as daily
food, because no one was ever certain of even one good meal
in the day.</p>

<p>So that in those early times there was a very sound,
well-grounded knowledge of roots, bulbs, and fruits. They
knew all that were good to eat, all that could possibly be
eaten in time of famine and starvation, and also every
poisonous and unwholesome plant.</p>

<p>Some savage genius must have discovered that certain
plants were "good medicine"; that certain tree-barks
helped to check fever, and that others were worth trying
when people had successfully devoured more than they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
could comfortably digest. The life of a savage meant
tremendous meals, followed by days of starvation; even
now, when young children are fed on rice in India, a thread
is tied round their waist, and, when this bursts, they are not
allowed to eat any more.</p>

<p>Very probably some of these early physicians were lady
doctors usually of a certain age. Men were too busy with
their hunting and warfare to have time to try experiments
with drugs, to make concoctions of herbs all more or less
disquieting and to find out if these were of any use.</p>

<p>So that such medicine-men or witches gradually came to
understand enough about poisons or fruits to make themselves
respected and even feared. They would, no doubt,
make botanical excursions in the forest, accompanied by
their pupils, in order to point out the poisonous and useful
drugs.</p>

<p>It is worth noting, in passing, that this habit of botanical
professors going on excursions with medical students has
persisted down to our own times, probably without any
break in the continuity.</p>

<p>But it was soon found advisable to make this knowledge
secret and difficult to get. They did not really know so very
much, and a mysterious, solemn manner and a quantity of
horrible and unusual objects placed about the hut<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> would
perhaps prevent some irate and impatient savage patient
from throwing a spear at his wizard&mdash;or witch-doctor.</p>

<p>Shakespeare alludes to this in <em>Macbeth</em>. "Scale of
Dragon; tooth of wolf; witches' mummy; maw and gulf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of the ravin'd salt sea shark; root of hemlock digg'd i' the
dark; ... gall of goat and slips of yew"; and so on.</p>

<p>Most of their cures were faith-cures, and they were, no
doubt, much more likely to be successful when the patient
believed he was being treated with some dreadful stew of all
sorts of wonderful and horrible materials.</p>

<p>This explains how it was that the knowledge of medicine
became so mixed up with pure charlatanism and swindling
that no man could tell which drugs were of real use and which
were mere ornaments giving piquancy and flavour to the
prescription. It is not possible to say that a snake's head,
the brain of a toad, the gall of a crocodile, and the whiskers
of a tiger, were all of them absolutely useless. Within the
last few years it has been found that an antidote to snake-bite
can be obtained from a decoction of part of the snake
itself, and it has also been discovered that small quantities
of virulent poisons are amongst our most valuable and
powerful remedies.</p>

<p>Whether the savages and their successors the doctors of
feudal times even down to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
suspected or believed that this was the case must remain
a rather doubtful hypothesis, but there is no question
"that the hair of the dog that bit him" theory of medicine
was very prevalent.</p>

<p>The following was a cure for hydrophobia of a more
elaborate nature: "I learned of a Friend who had tried it
effectual to cure the Biting of a Mad Dog; take the Leaves
and Roots of Cowslips, of the leaves of Box and Pennyroyal
of each a like quantity; shred them small to put them into
Hot Broth and let it be so taken Three Days Together and
apply the herbs to the bitten place with Soap and Hog's
suet melted together" (Parkinson).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
This prescription is not so preposterous as it sounds. Box
and Pennyroyal both contain essences which would be in all
probability fatal to the germ of hydrophobia, and the soap
and hog's suet would keep air from the wound.</p>

<p>Other prescriptions read like our modern patent medicines.</p>

<p>"Good Cloves comfort the Brain and the Virtue of Feeling,
and help also against Indigestion and Ache of the
Stomach" (Bartholomew).</p>

<p>"Senvey" (the old name of mustard) "healeth smiting of
Serpents and overcometh venom of the Scorpions and
abateth Toothache and cleanseth the Hair and letteth"
(that is, prevents or tends to prevent) "the falling thereof.
If it be drunk fasting, it makes the Intellect good."</p>

<p>Even in those days the people can scarcely have believed
that drinking mustard improved the intellect. Many of the
remedies and cures are obviously false, for example the
following:-</p>

<p>"A man crowned with Ivy cannot get drunk."</p>

<p>"Powder of dry Roses comforteth wagging Teeth that be
in point to fall."</p>

<p>The fact that the surgeon was also a barber, and also a
"face-specialist," appears from the two following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leaves of Chestnut burnt to powder and tempered with
Vinegar and laid to a man's Head plaisterwise maketh Hair
increase and keepeth hair from falling."</p>

<p>Those whose hair turned grey could employ the following
prescription:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leaves of Mulberry sod in rainwater maketh black
hair."</p>

<p>If a doctor was not quite sure of the endurance of a
patient under these heroic remedies, he could easily find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
if he would recover, for it was only necessary to try the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Celandine with the heart of a Mouldwarp" (that is mole,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scottice</i> moudiewort) "laid under the Heade of one that is
grievouslie Sicke, if he be in danger of Death, immediately
he will cry out with a loud voice or sing; if not, he will
weep."</p>

<p>In Lightfoot's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flora Scotica</i>, there is an interesting
account of the Fly Mushroom (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agaricus muscarius</i>) which is
not very rare in Britain, and which may be easily recognized
by the bright red top or cap, with whitish scales scattered
over it, and a sort of ring of loose white tissue round the
stalk.</p>

<p>"It has an acrid and deleterious quality. The inhabitants
of Kamschatka prepare a liquor from an infusion of
this Agaric which taken in a small quantity exhilarates the
spirits, but in a larger dose brings on a trembling of the
nerves, intoxication, delirium and melancholy. Linnæus
informs us that flies are killed or at least stupefied by an infusion
of this fungus in milk and that the expressed juice
of it anointed on bedsteads and other places effectually
destroys"&mdash;what we may describe as certain lively and
pertinacious insects with a great affection for man!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the fungus is said to be a deadly
poison.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>These quotations are enough to show how the real medical
knowledge of those times was encrusted with all sorts of
faith-curing devices, sheer falsehoods, and superstitions. The
most learned men of the Middle Ages were almost invariably
monks and hermits, for there was nothing in the world of
those strenuous times to attract a studious, sensitive disposition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
The spirit of their learning can be judged from the
wearisome disquisitions and lengthy volumes written about
the Barnacle Goose and Scythian Lamb.</p>

<p>In certain deserts along the Volga River in Russia, a
peculiar fern may be found. It might be described as
resembling a gigantic Polypody; the stem is about as thick
as a lamb's body and grows horizontally on the ground like
that of the common fern mentioned; thick furry scales cover
the outside of its stem, which ends at the tip in an elongated
point. The blackish-green leaf-stalks springing from the
furry stem end in large divided green leaves.</p>

<p>It occurred to some medieval humorist to cut off the
upper part of the leaf-stalks, and to make a sort of toy lamb
out of the four leaf-stalk stumps and part of the woolly or
furry stem.</p>

<p>This was palmed off as a wonderful curiosity of nature, as
"a plant that became an animal," upon the ingenuous
tourist of the period.</p>

<p>Such a subject was thoroughly congenial to the learned
mind in the Middle Ages, and an enormous quantity of
literature was produced in consequence. The general theory
is given in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Cradled in snow and fanned by Arctic air,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Shines, gentle Barometz, thy golden hair,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Rooted in earth each cloven hoof descends,</div>
<div class="line i0h">And round and round her flexile neck she bends,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Crops the grey coralmoss and hoary thyme,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Or laps with rosy tongue the melting rime,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Eyes with mute tenderness her distant dam,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Or seems to bleat, a vegetable lamb."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such is the old idea of a well-known fern, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cibotium
barometz</i>.</p>

<p>Yet the original researches of some African "Obi" wizard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
or red Indian were not forgotten, and gradually came into
practice.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It must be remembered that these savages were true
scientific experimentalists, and made discoveries which have
been of infinite service to mankind. We remember great
men like Harvey, Lister, and Pasteur, but we never think
of the Indian who discovered quinine.</p>

<p>The quinine trees, the yellow variety or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calisaya cinchona</i>,
grow in the mountains of north-eastern Bolivia and south-eastern
Peru, in wild, inaccessible places at heights of 5000
to 6000 feet. The Indians probably experimented with
almost every part of every wild tree before they discovered
the wonderful properties of this particular species. The
quinine in nature is probably intended to prevent some fungus
or small insect from attacking the bark: when quinine
is used in malaria, it kills the fever germ which attacks the
blood corpuscles of the sick person, so that it is of the
utmost importance in all tropical countries.</p>

<p>When the Jesuit fathers reached Peru and made friends
and converts of the Indians, they discovered this remedy.
Soon after the Countess de Chinchon, wife of the Viceroy of
Peru, fell seriously ill of fever and was cured by the use of
Jesuit's bark or quinine. It was introduced into Europe
about 1638, but for a very long time the entire supply came
from South America. The British Indian government were
paying some £12,000 every year for South American quinine
and, at the same time, the supply was running short, for the
Indians were cutting down every tree.</p>

<p>At last, in 1859 (on the suggestion of Dr. Royle in 1839),
the adventurous journeys of Clements Markham, Spruce, and
Robert Cross resulted in the introduction of the Cinchona
now flourishing in Madras, Bombay, and Ceylon. In 1897
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
British colonies produced about £43,415 worth of quinine,
and the price is now only 7-1/2d. or 8d. a pound!</p>

<p>Such drugs as Safflower are of very ancient date. It was
commonly employed in Egypt with other dyes and spices for
embalming mummies. It is now used with carbonate of
soda and citric acid to give a pink dye to silks and satins,
and occasionally, in the form of rouge, to ladies' cheeks!
How did the ancient Egyptians discover that this particular
thistle-like plant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carthamus tinctorius</i>) had flowers from
which a red dye could be extracted by a tedious process of
soaking in water? The natural colour of the flowers is not
red but yellow.</p>

<p>The history of other drugs reads like a romance. Ipecacuanha,
for instance, was discovered by some unknown
Indian who lived in the damp tropical forests of Brazil and
New Granada. A worthy merchant in Paris obtained a little
of the drug in the way of trade. Shortly afterwards he
became very ill and was attended by a certain Dr. Helvetius,
who was exceedingly attentive to him. The grateful merchant
gave the kind-hearted physician some ipecacuanha. In
the course of time the great King Louis XIV's son fell ill of
dysentery, and Helvetius received 1000 louis d'or for his
ipecacuanha.</p>

<p>A very interesting and romantic history might be written
about the effect of drugs, dyes, and spices in developing
trade. During the time when Britain was struggling to
obtain a share of the foreign trade of Holland and France,
such spices as Clove, Cinnamon, and Pepper were of the
greatest importance. The Dutch, especially, adopted every
possible method to keep the spice trade in their own hands.
They cut down the clove, cinnamon, and other trees, in all
the islands not directly under their control. They imposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the most barbarous penalties on any interloper. For instance,
any one who sold a single stick of cinnamon in
Ceylon was punished with death. When the English captured
the island in 1796, all such restrictions were of course
repealed. Nevertheless its cultivation remained a monopoly
of the East India Company until 1832.</p>

<p>Logwood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haematoxylon campechianum</i>) is closely connected
with the story of adventure and colonisation in the
West Indies. Its use was at first forbidden by Queen
Elizabeth as it did not yield fast colours; this was because
the dyers of those times did not know of any mordant to
fix them. Yet this is one of the few vegetable dyes which
retain their position in the market in these days of aniline
colours, and it is said to be a large constituent, with brandy,
of cheap "port wine."</p>

<p>Indigo was known to the Romans, who imported it from
India on camel-back by way of the Persian and Syrian
desert. In the fifteenth century, when the Dutch began to
introduce it in large quantities, it was found to interfere
with the "woad"<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Isatis tinctoria</i>) which was then a very
important cultivated plant in Europe. In Nuremberg, an
oath was administered once a year to all the manufacturers
and dyers, by which they bound themselves not to use the
"devil's dye," as they called Indigo. Its more recent history
shows a very different system. In Assam and other
parts of British India, enormous sums of money have been
invested in indigo plantations. It has been estimated that
four million pounds was invested, and that a population of
something like 700 Europeans and 850 workmen to the square
mile in Behar, were entirely supported by indigo plantations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Now all these planters are ruined and the population
is dispersed, because German indigo manufactured from
coal-tar is destroying the sale of the British-grown material.
The plant has pretty blue flowers and belongs to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminous</i> order. The dye is obtained by steeping the
leaves and young branches in water, and it is finally turned
out in blue powder or cakes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of all these drugs is Pepper.
The Dutch, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, had a monopoly
of the East Indian trade, and they tried to cut down or
burn all spice trees except those in their own control. They
could thus form a corner in pepper, and alter the price as
they felt inclined. At one period they doubled the price,
raising it from three shillings to six shillings per pound.
This annoyed the London merchants so much that they met
together and formed the "Society of Merchants and Adventurers
trading to the East Indies." This was of course the
original source of our great East Indian trade, and later on
resulted in the Indian Empire.</p>

<p>At present, and for centuries past, the whole world is
searched and explored for drugs and spices. Our medicinal
rhubarb for instance, grows in China on the frontiers of
Tibet; it is carried over the mountains of China to Kiaghta
in Siberia, and from thence taken right across Russian
Siberia to London and New York. It is closely allied to
the common or garden rhubarb, which grows wild on the
banks of the Volga.</p>

<p>It is only our duty to remember with gratitude all those
long since departed botanists who have made our life so full
of luxury and have supplied our doctors with all kinds of
medicines.</p>

<p>The first doctors were of course just savage botanists, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
as soon as men began to write down their experiences, we find
botanical treatises. The first, and for a very long time the
only, botanical books were intended to teach medical students
the names and how to recognize useful flowers and drugs.</p>

<p>Medicinal herbs such as mandrake, garlic, and mint are
found described on those clay cylinders which were used in
Babylon instead of books, about 4000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, that is some 6000
years ago! The Egyptians thought that "kindly, healing
plants," such as opium, almonds, figs, castor-oil, dates, and
olives, were derived from the "blood and tears of the
gods"; that would be about 3000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> It is not known how
far back Chinese botany can be traced, but, by the twelfth
century before Christ, some three hundred plants were known,
including ginger, liquorice, rhubarb, and cinnamon.</p>

<p>Theophrastus, who flourished about 300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, was a scientific
botanist far ahead of his time. His notes about the
mangroves in the Persian gulf are still of some importance.
It is said that some two thousand botanical students attended
his lectures.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is doubtful if any professor of botany has
ever since that time had so large a number of pupils.
Dioscorides, who lived about 64 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, wrote a book which was
copied by the Pliny (78 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>), who perished in the eruption
of Vesuvius. The botany of the Middle Ages seems to have
been mainly that of Theophrastus and Dioscorides. In the
tenth century we find an Arab, Ibn Sina, whose name has
been commemorated in the name of a plant, Avicennia, publishing
the first illustrated text-book, for he gave coloured
diagrams to his pupils.</p>

<p>After this there was exceedingly little discovery until
comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>But Grew in 1682 and Malpighi in 1700 began to work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
with the microscope, and with the work of Linnæus in 1731
modern botany was well started and ready to develop.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the numbers of plants known
at various periods, so as to see how greatly our knowledge has
been increased of recent years. Theophrastus (300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) knew
about 500 plants. Pliny (78 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) knew 1000 species by
name. Linnæus in 1731 raised the number to 10,000.
Saccardo in 1892 gives the number of plants then known as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>But, during the years that have elapsed since 1892, many
new species have been described, so that we may estimate
that at least 200,000 species are now known to mankind.</p>

<p>But it is in the inner meaning and general knowledge of
the life of plants that modern botany has made the most extraordinary
progress. It is true that we are still burdened
with medieval terminology. There are such names as
"galbulus," "amphisarca," and "inferior drupaceous pseudocarps,"
but these are probably disappearing.</p>

<p>The great ideas that plants are living beings, that every
detail in their structure has a meaning in their life, and that
all plants are more or less distant cousins descended from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
common ancestor, have had extraordinary influence in overthrowing
the unintelligent pedantry so prevalent until 1875.</p>

<p>Yet there were many, not always botanists, of much older
date, who made great discoveries in the science. Leonardo
da Vinci, the great painter, seems to have had quite a
definite idea of the growth of trees, for he found out that
the annual rings on a tree-stem are thin on the northern and
thick on the southern side of the trunk. Dante<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> seems to
have also understood the effect of sunlight in ripening the
vine and producing the growth of plants (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Purgatorio</i>,
xxv. 77). Goethe seems to have been almost the first to
understand how leaves can be changed in appearance when
they are intended to act in a different way. Petals, stamens,
as well as some tendrils and spines, are all modified leaves.
There is also a passage in Virgil, or perhaps more distinctly
in Cato, which is held to show that the ancients knew that
the group of plants, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminosæ</i>, in some way improved
the soil. I have also tried to show that Shelley had a more
or less distinct idea of the "warning" or conspicuous colours
(reds, purples, spotted, and speckled) which are characteristic
of many poisonous plants (see p. <a href="#Page_238">238</a>).</p>

<p>But if we begin with the unlettered savage, one can trace
the very slow and gradual growth of the science of plant-life
persisting all through the Dark Ages, the Middle Ages, and
recent times, until about fifty or sixty years ago, when a
sudden great development began, which gives us, we hope,
the promise of still more wonderful discoveries.</p>

the cow is adjured not to eat in Wordsworth's well-known

a fine handsome tree which is common in the forests of
Eastern North America.</p>

<p>These primeval forests of Pine and Fir and Spruce have
always taken the fancy of poets. They are found covering
craggy and almost inaccessible mountain valleys; even a
tourist travelling by train cannot but be impressed by their
sombre, gloomy monotony, by their obstinacy in growing on

<p class="smcap">A Giant Douglas Fir</p>
<p>This species of fir tree grows to an enormous height in British Columbia. It is
now being planted in many Scotch forests.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But to realize the romance of a Pine forest, it is necessary
to tramp, as in Germany one sometimes has to do, for thirty
miles through one unending black forest of Coniferous trees;
there are no towns, scarcely a village or a forester's hut. The
ground is covered with brown, dead needles, on which scarcely
even green moss can manage to live.</p>

<p>Then one realizes the irritating monotony of the branches
of Pines and Spruces, and their sombre, dark green foliage
produces a morose depression of spirit.</p>

<p>The Conifers are, amongst trees, like those hard-set,
gloomy, and determined Northern races whose life is one
long, continuous strain of incessant endeavour to keep alive
under the most difficult conditions.</p>

<p>From its very earliest infancy a young Pine has a very
hard time. The Pine-cones remain on the tree for two years.
The seeds inside are slowly maturing all this while, and the
cone-scales are so welded or soldered together by resin and
turpentine that no animal could possibly injure them.
How thorough is the protection thus afforded to the young
seeds, can only be understood if one takes a one-year-old
unopened cone of the Scotch Fir and tries to get them out.
It does not matter what is used; it may be a saw, a chisel,
a hammer, or an axe: the little elastic, woody, turpentiny
thing can only be split open with an infinite amount of
trouble and a serious loss of calm.</p>

<p>When these two years have elapsed, the stalk of the cone
grows so that the scales are separated, and the seeds become
rapidly dry and are carried away by the wind.</p>

<p>These seeds are most beautiful and exquisitely fashioned.</p>

<p>The seed itself is small and flattened. It contains both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
resin and food material, and is enclosed in a tough leathery
skin which is carried out beyond the seed into a long, very
thin, papery wing, which has very nearly the exact shape of
the screw or propeller of a steamer. This wing or screw is
intended to give the seed as long a flight in the air as
possible before it reaches the ground. If you watch them
falling from the tree, or throw one up into the air and
observe it attentively, you will see that it twirls or revolves
round and round exactly like the screw of a steamship. It is
difficult to explain what happens without rather advanced
mathematics, but it is just the reverse of what happens in
the steamer.</p>

<p>The machinery in the steamer turns the screw, and the
pressure of the water, which is thrown off, forces the boat
through the water; in the case of the pineseed, the pressure
of the air on the flying wings makes the seed twirl or turn
round and round, and so the seed must be a much longer
time in falling. They often fly to about 80 or 100 yards
away from the parent tree.</p>

<p>Once upon the ground, the seed has to germinate <em>if it
can</em>; its root has to pierce the soil or find a way in between
crevices of rocks or sharp-edged stones. All the time it is
exposed to danger from birds, beasts, and insects, which are
only kept off by its resin. But it is difficult to see, for its
colour is just that of dead pine needles and its shape is such
that it easily slips into crevices. Then the seven or eight
small green seed leaves break out of the tough seed coat, and
the seedling is now a small tree two inches high. It may
have to grow up through grass or bramble, or through
bracken, which last is perhaps still more dangerous and difficult.
It will probably be placed in a wood or plantation
where hundreds of thousands of its cousins are all competing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
together. "In this case, the struggle for life is intense: each
tree seeking for sunlight tries to push its leader-shoots up
above the general mass of foliage; but all are growing in
height, whilst the lateral branches which are cramped by the
neighbouring trees are continually thrown off. The highest
branches alone get sufficient light to remain alive, but they
cannot spread out freely. They are strictly limited to a
definite area; the crown is small and crowded by those of
the trees next to it, and the trunk is of extraordinary
length."</p>

<p>The above quotation from Albert Fron's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylviculture</i>
(Paris, 1903) refers to an artificial forest cultivated and
watched over by man. But the trees in such forests have
"extra" dangers and difficulties to fight against. Even
scientific foresters admit that they are very ignorant of what
they are trying to do. In fact, the more scientific they are,
the more readily they will confess how little they really
know.</p>

<p>Watch a labourer in a nursery transplanting young pine
trees; each seedling tree has a long main root which is
intended to grow as straight down into the ground as it
possibly can. All the other roots branch off sideways,
slanting downwards, and make a most perfect though complicated
absorbing system. With his large hand the man
grasps a tree and lifts it to a shallow groove which he has cut
in the soil. Then his very large, heavy-nailed boot comes
hard down on the tender root-system. The main root,
which ought to point down, points sideways or upwards or
in any direction, and the beautifully arranged absorbing
system is entirely spoilt. The wretched seedling has to
make a whole new system of roots, and in some trees never
recovers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
All sorts of animals, insects, and funguses are ready to
attack our young tree. Squirrels in play will nibble off its
leading shoots. Cattle will rub against its bark, and the
roedeer, a very beautiful creature, and yet a destructive little
fiend from the tree's point of view, nibbles the young shoots
and tears the bark with its horns.</p>

<p>A tree's life is full of peril and danger. Yet it is most
wonderfully adapted to survive them. Take a knife and cut
into the bark of a pine tree, and immediately a drop of resin
collects and gathers on the wound. After a short time this
will harden and entirely cover the scar. Why?</p>

<p>There are in the woods, especially in Canada and North
Russia, hundreds of insects belonging to the most different
kinds, which have the habit of laying their eggs in the wood
of tree-trunks. In those regions the entire country is in the
winter covered with snow and ice for many months. Insects
must find it difficult to live, for the ground is frozen to a
depth of many feet. Where are the eggs of these insects to
be stored up so that they can last through the winter without
injury?</p>

<p>There is one insect at least, or rather many, of which the
Giant Sawfly may be taken as an example, which have
ingeniously solved this problem. She painfully burrows
into the trunk of a tree and deposits her eggs with a store
of food at the end of the burrow. A drop of resin or
turpentine, which would clog her jaws, makes this a difficult
task, but, as we find in many other instances, it is not
impossible, but only a difficulty to conquer. If it were not
for the resin, trees might be much more frequently destroyed
by Sawflies than they are.</p>

<p>The larvæ of the Sawfly is a long, fleshy maggot. Just at
the end are the strong woodcutting jaws by which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
devours the wood and eats its way out as soon as it feels the
genial warmth of spring penetrating through the tree-bark.
Many other insects hibernate or lay their eggs in tree-trunks.
Some are caterpillars of moths, such as the well-known Goat
moth; others are beetles, such as one which burrows between
the bark and the wood of apple trees. The mother
beetle lays a series of eggs on each side of her own track.
Each egg produces a grub which eats its way sideways away
from the track of the mother. The track made by these
grubs gets gradually wider, because the maggots themselves
grow larger and more fat with the distance that they have
got from their birthplace. We shall find other instances of
burrowing insects when we are dealing with rubber plants.</p>

<p>This resin or turpentine is a very interesting and peculiar
substance, or rather series of substances. It is valuable
because tar, pitch, rosin, and colophony are obtained by
distilling it.</p>

<p>When travelling through the coast forests of pine trees in
the Landes of Western France, one notices great bare gashes
on the stems leading round and down the trunk to a small
tin cup or spout. These trees are being tapped for resin,
from which rosin is manufactured. It would be difficult to
find any obvious connexion between music and the Giant
Sawfly. Yet the rosin used by Paganini and Kubelik has
probably been developed in Conifers to keep away sawflies
and other enemies. This very district, the Landes in France,
was once practically a desert, and famous as such in French
history. The soil was so barren that no villages or cultivation
were found over the whole length of it. Now that
it is planted with trees which are able to yield firewood
and rosin, it is comparatively rich and prosperous.</p>

<p>Storms are also very dangerous for tree-life. One can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
only realize the beauty of a tree by watching a pine or ash
in a heavy gale of wind. The swing of the branches, the
swaying of the trunk, the balancing support of the roots
which, buttress-like, extend out into the soil, give some
idea of the extraordinary balance, toughness, and strength
in trees. Except in the case of the common umbrella,
which is an inefficient instrument in high wind, engineers
have never attempted the solution of the problem satisfactorily
solved by trees. A factory chimney only 51 feet
in height will have a diameter at the base of at least three
feet. This means that the height is about seventeen times
its diameter. But the Ryeplant, with a diameter at base
of 3 millimetres, may be 1500 mm. high! That is, the
height is five hundred times its diameter, and the Ryeplant
has leaves and grain to support as well as its own stem! In
Pine forests on exposed mountain sides there is almost always
at least a murmuring sound, which in a storm rises into
weird howls and shrieks. With Greek insight and imagination,
the ancients supposed that spirits were imprisoned in
these suffering, straining pines. That is most beautifully
expressed in <cite>The Tempest</cite>, where the dainty spirit Ariel had
been painfully confined in a pine tree for a dozen years, and
"his groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
of ever-angry bears."</p>

<p>One of the most interesting points in botany depends on
the fact that evil conditions of any sort tend to bring about
their own remedy. Endymion's spear was of "toughest ash
grown on a windy site" (Keats). The prosaic chemical
analyses of German botanists have, in fact, confirmed the
theory there suggested, for it is found that the wood of trees
grown in exposed windy places is really denser and tougher
than that of others from sheltered woods.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
If one realizes all these dangers from insects, animals, and
storms, the height to which some trees grow and the age
to which they live become matters for astonishment and
surprise.</p>

<p>The tallest trees in the world are probably certain
Eucalyptus of Australia, which have obtained a height of
495 feet above the ground.</p>

<p>They are by no means the <em>longest</em> plants, for there are certain
<i>rattans</i> or canes, climbing plants belonging to the Palm
family, which may be 900 feet long, although their diameter
is not more than two inches.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There are also certain Seaweeds
in the Southern Ocean, off the coast of Chile, which
attain a prodigious length of 600 feet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macrocystis pyriferus</i>,
or "Kelp"). That is not so remarkable, for their weight
is supported by other plants in the case of the rattans,
and as regards the seaweeds, by the water in which they
float.</p>

<p>The next in order to the Eucalyptus are those well-known
Mammoth or Big trees of California (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sequoia gigantea</i>).
They grow only in certain valleys in the Sierra Nevada, at an
altitude of 5000-8000 feet. Their height is usually given as
from 250-400 feet, and the diameter sometimes exceeds
thirty-five feet. Since they have become a centre of the
tourist-industry in the United States, various methods have
been adopted to make their size more easily realized. Thus
a coach with four horses and covered by passengers is (or
used to be) driven through a gateway made in one of them.
The trunk of another has been cut off some feet from the
ground, and a dancing-saloon has been made on the stump.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
It is at least doubtful if dancing would be very agreeable
upon such a cross-grained sort of floor! A complete section
of one of them was carried across the United States to make
a dining-room table for an American millionaire. The age
of one of these trees has been estimated at 3300 years. That
is to say that it was a seedling in 1400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and has been
peacefully growing in a Californian valley during all the time
when Greece, Rome, Spain, France, Britain, and of course
the United States, developed their civilizations. The specimen
of the Mammoth tree in the Natural History Museum
in London was 1335 years old.</p>

<p>The possible age of many of our common trees is much
greater than any one would suppose. The "Jupiter" oak
in the forest of Fontainebleau is supposed to be 700 years
old. Another oak which was cut down at Bordya, in the
Baltic provinces of Russia, was supposed to be about 1000
years old. Other millennial trees are or were another oak
and two chestnuts: the oak grew in the Ardennes, the
chestnuts still flourish, one at Sancerre (France), and the
other the famous specimen on Mount Etna. There are
also eight olive trees in the garden of Gethsemane at
Jerusalem, which are certainly 1000 years old, and were,
according to tradition, in existence in the time of Jesus

<p>And yet all these trees are mere infants compared to
Adanson's Baobab and the Dragon tree of Orotava. The
celebrated traveller alluded to visited the Cape Verde islands
in 1749 and found inscriptions made by English travellers
on the trunk 300 years before his time. From the growth
since then, he calculated that some of these trees were about
6000 years of age, and they were 27 feet in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="smcap">A Dragon Tree in the Canary Islands</p>
<p>Said to be about eight hundred years old</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
The record is held by the Dragon tree of Orotava, in the
Canary Islands.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards landed in Teneriffe in 1402, its
diameter was very nearly 42 feet. It was, however, greatly
injured by a storm in 1827, and finally destroyed in 1851.
(The wood was then made into walking-sticks and snuffboxes.)
The age has been estimated at 10,000 years, or by other
authorities at 8000 years only. The "dragon's blood" of
the Canaries, a well-known remedy in the Middle Ages, was
not, as is popularly supposed, derived from this tree, but was
obtained from a totally different plant.</p>

<p>But there is a hazy tradition to the effect that the story
of the Dragon which guarded the golden fruit in the island
of the Hesperides was nothing but a garbled account of this
redoubtable veteran of the plant world.</p>

<p>There is no particular advantage in growing to these
enormous heights and clinging to life in this way for hundreds
and thousands of years. Nature seems to have found
this out and preferred the ordinary pines, oaks, and larches,
which are mature in a few hundred years. In a thousand
years, ten generations of larch or pine can be produced, and,
as each is probably better than its predecessor, a distinct
improvement in the type is possible. All these long-lived
giants belong in fact to the less highly specialized orders of
plants. They are like the primeval animals, the Mammoths,
Atlantosauri, and Sabretoothed Tigers.</p>

<p>Yet when we come to think of the many and diverse
perils to which trees are exposed, the existence of even these
exceptional monsters seems very wonderful.</p>

<p>After a violent storm which had blown down many of the
trees in a friend's park,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I visited the scene of destruction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
discovered what had apparently in almost every instance
produced it. Rabbits had overthrown these trees!</p>

<p>They had nibbled away part of the cork and part of the
young wood on the projecting buttress-like roots at the base
of the tree. In consequence, water, bacteria, and fungus
spores had entered at the injured places, and part of the
roots had become decayed and rotten. When the gale
began to sway them backwards and forwards and a severe
strain came on what should have been a sound anchoring or
supporting buttress, the rotten part yielded, and these fine,
beautiful trees fell a prey to the rabbit.</p>

<p>The influence of forests and timber on the daily life of
mankind is a most romantic and interesting chapter in history.</p>

<p>Every savage tribe, every race of man, however degraded
or backward, is acquainted with fire. Fuel is therefore a
necessity of existence for all savages, and not merely for
cooking. There is a very interesting passage in London's
<i>The Call of the Wild</i>, when the Dog "Buck" in his dreams
remembers a hairy man crouching over the fire with Buck's
ancestor at his feet, whilst in the darkness all round them
the firelight is reflected from eyes of wolves, bears, and even
more terrible and dangerous brutes which have now happily
vanished from the world. For protection at night fire was an
absolute necessity. Even at that long-distant period, therefore,
man had commenced to attack the forest. Unless one
has had to tend a wood fire for twelve hours, it is difficult to
realize what a quantity is required. To prepare fire was a
long, laborious, and difficult operation; one piece of wood
was placed on the ground and held in position by the toes,
a pointed stick was taken between the two palms of the hand
and twirled vigorously round and round until the heat was
enough to ignite a piece of rotten wood placed as tinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Therefore smouldering branches were kept always burning,
as they are to-day amongst the Fuegians and some other
savages. It was a sacred duty to watch this fire, and the
woman (usually old) who was entrusted with the task was
very probably put to death if she failed. From this very
ancient savage custom probably arose the cult of the Vestal
Virgins in Ancient Rome.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Another very important factor in savage life was the canoe
or piroque necessary for fishing or to cross lakes and rivers.
The first chantey of Rudyard Kipling has a probable theory,
and is a beautiful account of how man first thought of
using a floating log.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> They hollowed out the log and "dug
out" the canoe, by first lighting a fire on it and then scraping
away the cinders; then the sides were pressed out, and it
was trimmed and straightened to the right shape. All this
was the idea of some paleolithic genius far more persevering
and ingenious than any marine architect of our own days.</p>

<p>"Birchbark" canoes are not so common as Dug-outs. The
tree, the White or Paper Birch, is found in Canada and the
Northern United States; those Indians who discovered that
the light, waterproof cork-bark could be fashioned into a
canoe made a very great discovery, and indeed it was their
canoes that made travel or exploration possible in North
America.</p>

<p>When man began to long for a settled permanent home,
it was absolutely necessary to find a way of living in safety.
Wolves, bears, hyenas and other animals were abundant;
neighbours of his own or other tribes were more ferocious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and more dangerous than wild beasts. Some neolithic genius
imagined an artificial island made of logs in the midst of a
lake or inaccessible swamp. Such were the lake dwellings
which persisted into historic times, and which are indeed
still in existence in some parts of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The trees were abundant; they could be felled by the help
of fire and an axe, and the lake dwelling gave a secure
defence. The wood of some of the piles supporting the
great villages in Switzerland seems to be still sound, though it
has been under water for many centuries. Some villages are
said to have required hundreds of thousands of trees.</p>

<p>The forest afforded man almost everything that he used,
bows and arrows, shelter, fuel, and even part of his food.</p>

<p>Nuts and fruits would be collected and when possible
stored. In seasons of famine, they used even to eat the
delicate inside portion of the bark of trees.</p>

<p>But as soon as the first half-civilized men began to keep
cattle, sheep, and especially goats, more serious inroads still
were made upon the forest. Where such animals are allowed
to graze there is no chance for wood to grow (at any rate in
a temperate country). The growing trees and the branches
of older ones are nibbled away whilst they are young and
tender. The days of the forest were nearly over when
cultivation commenced. Dr. Henry describes the process of
"nomadic" culture in China as follows: "They burn down
areas of the forest; gather one or two crops of millet or
upland rice from the rich forest soil; and then pass on to
another district where they repeat the destruction."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A
very similar process of agriculture existed until the eighteenth
century in Scotland.</p>

<p class="smcap">Shooting the Hozu Rapids in Japan</p>
<p>The logs in the long train of rafts are of bamboo tied together. In spite of their fragile nature
the lumbermen are so fearless and agile that they cleverly steer the frail bundles with but few
accidents.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Thus the forest was being burnt or cleared for cultivation.
It was devastated by black cattle, goats, and other animals,
and it was regularly exploited for fuel and building every
day by every family for centuries.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, surprising that the ancient forests
in Britain have disappeared. Dr. Henry mentions one
square mile of virgin forest on the Clonbrock estate in
Ireland. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Silva Caledonica</i> of the Romans is said to
exist in Scotland at the Blackwood of Rothiemurchus,
at Achnacarry, and in a few other places. Of the original
oak forest, which covered most of England and Southern
Scotland, not a vestige (so far as is known to the writer)
remains to-day.</p>

<p>There are in places very ancient forests. A few miles
from Retford are considerable remains of Sherwood Forest,
which is for ever associated with that genial bandit Robin
Hood. One huge oak (called the Major) has or used to have
a keeper always on guard and paid by Lord Manvers, but
there are hundreds of aged oaks all round it. Then there
is the Knightwood Oak and some other ancients in the New
Forest.</p>

<p>But it is not certain that these even date so far back
as the time of Canute, for so far as the New Forest is concerned,
it seems that this was formed either by Canute or by
William I. The Saxons seem to have destroyed most of the
English forests.</p>

<p>In Scotland oak forest existed as far north as the Island
of Lewis, in Caithness, Dornoch, Cromarty, and along Loch
Ness, as well as in every county south of these.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The deer
forests and grouse moors, now desolate, whaup-haunted muir-land
and peat mosses, were flourishing woods of magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Scots fir at no very distant period. They ascended the hills
on the Cairngorms to 1400 or 1500 feet, and in Yorkshire
to 2400 feet.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Even in remote historical times, such as those of Canute,
the forests had become seriously and dangerously destroyed.
This king was apparently the first to artificially protect the
woods as a hunting preserve. He was followed by William
the Conqueror and other sovereigns. The game preserves
of the landed proprietors to-day are, of course, the remains
of the same custom.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, we do not kill poachers or cut off
their right hands, and we do not cut off the forepaws of
poaching dogs, as used to be done in medieval days.</p>

<p>This connexion of forests with game no doubt prevented
the entire disappearance of wood, but when, as is the case
in England, the comfort of pheasants is thought of more
importance than the scientific cultivation of forests, the
result is often very unfortunate.</p>

<p>The use and value of timber is, however, too important
a matter to take up at the end of a chapter.</p>

Woods in Britain.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HAT was the first tree like? That is a very difficult
question to answer. Perhaps the first forests
were those of the great coal period, of which the
remains, buried for untold ages in the earth, became the
coal which we now burn.</p>

<p>The flames and red-glowing heat of a fire are the work of
the sunlight which fell in these long-past ages through a
steamy, misty atmosphere, upon these weird, grotesque
vegetables, unlike anything which now exists upon the earth.
Their nearest allies amongst living plants are the little club-mosses
which creep over the peat and through the heather
in alpine districts.</p>

<p>Of course no one can say exactly what these coal forests
were like. But although some modern authorities have
questioned the general accuracy of the descriptions of Heer
and others, yet, as they have not given anything better in
the way of description, we shall endeavour to describe them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
according to our own beliefs, and as they probably existed
in the Lanarkshire coalfield and other places in Britain.</p>

<p>In that gloomy mirk of the Carboniferous epoch, an
observer (if there had been any) would have dimly perceived
huge trunks rising to sixty or eighty feet and divided at the
top into a very few branches. All branches were covered over
by comparatively quite small leaves. Not a bad idea of the
Sigillarias, Lepidodendrons, etc., which made the forest and can
be obtained by carefully looking at a pan of Selaginella
such as one finds in almost every botanical garden, and
imagining this to be eighty feet high. Through the bottomless
oozy slime which formed the ground, horizontal runners and
roots penetrated in every direction. Great fern-like plants
might be observed here and there. Sluggish rivers meandered
slowly through these forests, carrying silt and refuse
(their deposits are our Cannel coals). In the water and in
pools, or perhaps in the mud, were curious waterferns with
coiled-up crozier-like leaves. Perhaps horsetail-like plants
of huge size might have formed great reed-beds to which
those of to-day are as a plantation of one-year-old firs is to
a pine forest that has lasted for a century.</p>

<p>Fishes and crustaceans, or lobster-like creatures, crawled
and squattered through the slime, pursued by salamander-like
animals with weak limbs and a long tail. Some of
these latter were seven to eight feet long. Millipedes,
scorpions, beetles and maybugs existed, and huge dragonflies
preyed on them.</p>

<p>But there is one very ancient group of trees, the Araucarias
or Monkey-puzzles, which are by no means uncommon
even now. The ordinary one (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Araucaria imbricata</i>) is often
planted in the British Isles, and it has, if you look closely
at it, a most peculiar appearance. It is like the sort of tree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
that a child would draw; it is a clumsy attempt at one, and
very different from the exquisite irregularity of the ash or
oak.</p>

<p>Its leaves are especially curious: they cover the branches
very closely, and are hard, rigid, and spiny. Its cones,
though of the nature of pine-cones, are yet quite unique.
The seeds are edible, and used to be an important article of
diet to the Indians on the slopes of the Chilian Andes,
where monkey-puzzle forests used to exist. This of course
is a very out-of-the-way region; other species of Araucaria
are found scattered about the world in a most perplexing
manner. One kind grows in Norfolk Island, in the Pacific;
another occurs in the inner mountainous districts of Brazil;
there are some in Australia and others in New Caledonia.</p>

<p>But in the Jurassic period of geology, in the age of
ammonites and gigantic lizards and crocodiles, Araucarias
were the regular, ordinary trees. They grew all over Europe,
and apparently as far north as Greenland, and, indeed, seem
to have existed everywhere.</p>

<p>Perhaps the spiny leaves discouraged some huge lizard,
perhaps Atlantosaurus himself (he was thirty feet high and
one hundred feet long), from browsing on its branches.
Perhaps the Pterodactyls, those extraordinary bird or bat-like
lizards, used to feed upon the seeds of the monkey-puzzle,
and carried them in their toothed jaws to New
Caledonia, Australia, and Norfolk Island. Other improved
types have driven the monkey-puzzles from Europe, Asia, and
Africa, and taken their places, but in out-of-the-way districts
of South America and Australia they are still able to hold
their own.</p>

<p>An ally of theirs, the Ginkgo or Maidenhair tree, seems to
have been extremely common in certain geological periods.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
To-day it has almost entirely disappeared. A few trees
were discovered in certain Chinese temples, where they had
been preserved as curiosities for centuries, but it is almost
extinct as a wild plant. The Bigtree group (<i>Sequoia</i> p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>)
was a companion of the Ginkgo in its flourishing period.
So also were the Sago palms or Cycads. All the ordinary
trees, Pines, Oaks, Beeches, and the like, did not appear upon
the earth's surface till a much later period.</p>

<p>The most important economic product of trees is the
timber which they furnish. Wood, as we have tried to show
in the last chapter, has been always of the greatest importance
to mankind. It is easily worked, durable, buoyant, and
light, and it is used for all sorts of purposes.</p>

<p>Silver fir,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which is accustomed, when growing, to be continually
swayed and balanced by the wind, is preferred for
the sounding-board of pianos and for the flat part of violins,
whilst Sycamore or hard Maple is employed for the back and
sides of the latter.</p>

<p>But there are enormous differences in different kinds of
woods. The colour of wood varies from white (Beech),
yellow (Satinwood), lemon-yellow and bluish red (sap and
heartwood of Barberry), to dark and light brown mottled
(Olive), black (Persimmon), and dark brown (Walnut). Some
woods have a distinct smell or perfume. Cedarwood, Sandalwood,
Deal, and Teak, are all distinctly fragrant. The
Stinkwood of South Africa and the Til of Madeira have an
unpleasant smell.</p>

<p>More important in practice are the differences in the hardness
and weight of wood. The Ironwood of India cannot be
worked, as its hardness blunts every tool. It requires a
pressure of something like 16,000 lb. to force a square-inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
punch to a depth of one-twentieth of an inch in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lignum vitæ</i>.
Even Hickory and Oak (if of good quality) require a pressure
of 3200 lb. to the square inch to do this. On the other
hand the Cotton tree of India (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombax malabaricum</i>) has
exceedingly soft wood. It is quite easy to drive a pin into
the wood with the fingers.</p>

<p>Some woods are far too heavy to float: many tropical
woods are especially very weighty. Perhaps the Black Ironwood,
of which a cubic foot weighs 85 lb., is the heaviest of
all. But the same volume of Poplar, Willow, or Spruce does
not weigh more than 24 lb.</p>

<p>There are many ancient and modern instances of the
extraordinary way in which timber lasts when at all carefully
looked after. Thus the Cedar which "Hiram rafted
down" to make the temple of Solomon (probably Cedar of
Lebanon) seems to have been extraordinarily durable. Pliny
says that the beams of the temple of Apollo at Utica were
sound 1200 years after they were erected.</p>

<p>Cypress wood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cupressus sempervirens</i>) was often used to
make chests for clothes because the clothes moth cannot
penetrate it, and it also lasts a very long time. There is a
chest of this wood in the South Kensington Museum which
is 600-700 years old. The Cypresswood gates of Constantinople
were eleven centuries old when they were
destroyed by the Turks in 1453. The fleet of Alexander
the Great, and the bridge over the Euphrates built by
Semiramis, were made of Cypress. This wood seems to have
been of extraordinary value to the ancients, and was used
for mummy cases in Egypt, for coffins by the Popes, as well
as for harps and organ pipes.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Perhaps the most valuable woods are Box, which is used
for woodcuts, and Walnut, which used to be highly prized
for gun-stocks, as much as £600 having been paid for
a single tree.</p>

<p>But the most interesting histories of trade in timber
belong to the commoner and more usual woods. The great
woods of Jarrah (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eucalyptus marginata</i>) cover 14,000
square miles of Australia, but they are being rapidly cut
down and sawn up into small blocks to be carried right
across the world in order to form the pavement which
London cabmen and cab-horses prefer to any other.</p>

<p>One remembers also the beautiful Deodar forests of
Afghanistan, and the Himalayas. Logs of deodar were floated
down the rivers to form bridges or temple pillars in Srinagar,
the capital of far Cashmere. Nowadays great "slides" are
made, winding down into the valleys from the recesses of the
hills. When winter approaches, water is sprinkled on the
logs which make the slide; this freezes and forms a slippery
descending surface, down which the deodar timber rushes till
it reaches the low ground, where it is cut up into railway
sleepers and takes part in the civilizing of India.</p>

<p>The fragrant Teak has an oleoresin which prevents the
destructive white ants from attacking it; it is the most
valuable timber for shipbuilding, and grows in many places
of India, Malaysia, Java, and Sumatra. It floats down the
rivers of Burmah, coming from the most remote hill jungles,
and elephants are commonly used at the ports to gather the
trunks from the water and pile them ready for shipment.</p>

<p>The Birch is carried all the way from Russia to Assam
and Ceylon, in order to make the chests in which tea is sent
to England and Russia (native Indian woods are also used).
It is also used in the distillation of Scotch whisky, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
smoking herrings and hams, for clogs, baskets, tanning,
dyeing, cordage, and even for making bread.</p>

<p>But one of the most curious and interesting sights in any
seaport is sure to be an old white Norwegian or Swedish
sailing barque or brigantine. She will have a battered, storm-beaten
appearance, and is yet obviously a comfortable home.
The windows of the deck-house may be picked out with a
lurid green. The tall, slowmoving, white-bearded skipper and
his wife, children, and crew, not to speak of a dog and cats,
have their home on this veteran "windjammer." She carries
them from some unpronounceable, never-heard-of port in
Norway, all over the world. You may see her discharging
a cargo of deal plank, through the clumsy square holes
in her stern, in a forgotten Fifeshire village, in Madagascar,
in China, or in the Straits of Magellan. All her life
she is engaged in this work, and her life is an exceedingly
long one, to judge from the Viking lines on which she is
built.</p>

<p>Moreover, her work is done so economically that it used
to be much cheaper to use her cargo in Capetown than to
utilize the beautiful forests of the Knysna and King
Williamstown.</p>

<p>But there are not wanting signs that the forests of Norway,
of Sweden, and even those of the United States, are
doomed.</p>

<p>It is said that seven acres of primeval forest are cut down
to supply the wood which is used up in making the paper
required for one day's issue of a certain New York journal.
What a responsibility and a source of legitimate pride this
must be to the journalists! Let us hope that the end
justifies the means.</p>

<p>Boulger calculates that in 1884 all the available timber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
from 4,131,520 acres of Californian Redwood was used in
making the sleepers of the railways then existing in the
United States.</p>

<p>He finds that no less than 18,000,000 acres of forest are
necessary to keep up the supply of sleepers for the old lines
and to build new ones.</p>

<p>So that, if we remember the wood required for paper,
firewood, and the thousand other important requisites of
civilized man, the United States must soon exhaust her
supply and import wood.</p>

<p>Then will come the opportunity of British North America.
The Southern forest of Canada, which extended for 2000
miles from the Atlantic to the head of the St. Lawrence, has
indeed gone or is disappearing into pulpwood and timber,
but there is still the great Northern forest from the Straits of
Belleisle to Alaska (4000 miles long and 700 miles broad),
and in addition the beautiful forests of Douglas Spruce and
other trees in British Columbia covering 285,000 square miles.</p>

<p>It is the wood-pulp industry which is at present destroying
the Canadian forests. The penny and halfpenny papers, and
indeed most books nowadays, are made of paper produced by
disintegrating wood: it is cheap, and can be produced in
huge quantities; nevertheless it is disquieting to reflect that
probably nineteen-twentieths of the literary output of the
twentieth century will be dust and ashes just about the same
time (some fifty years) that the writers who produced it reach
the same state.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Yet, considering the amount daily produced to-day, the
future readers of fifty years hence who are now in their cradles,
may consider this a merciful dispensation of Providence.</p>

<p>One very curious use of wood may be mentioned here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Near Assouan, on the First Cataract of the Nile, one discovers
broken granite or syenite needles, which had been
intended by the ancient Egyptians for monuments. Where
the broken pillar lies, there are rows of wedge-shaped holes
cut in the rock.</p>

<p>They used to drive in wedges of dry wood and then wet
them with water. The expansion of the wood split the rock,
though this is hard granite or syenite. Very often the process
failed because the stone cracked. The same method is said
to be still used in some quarries.</p>

<p>The destruction of the forest is really necessary. Most of
the corn land and rich pasture of the world has been at one
time forest. It could scarcely be such fertile soil if it had
not been for the many years during which leaf-mould fell on
it, and the roots broke up and penetrated the subsoil
below. Canada, Russia, and the United States are now passing
through the same experience as that of Great Britain
in the time of the Romans, Saxons, and Danes.</p>

<p>But there is terrible waste by fire.</p>

<p>When the trees become dry and withered in the height of
summer in either India or the United States, some careless
tramp may throw aside a lighted match. If a fire once
starts, it spreads with enormous rapidity; great clouds of
smoke roll over the surrounding country, and every village
sounds the alarm. Everybody rushes to help and try to
stop the conflagration, or if too late hurriedly saves whatever
he can get of his possessions. His log hut and all the
accumulations of years of saving may be turned into a
heap of ashes in a very few minutes.</p>

<p>But the crackling of the leaves and the flaming twigs and
scorching bark make such a volume of fire that nothing
which man can do is of any avail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Of course every beast, every bird and insect is in the
greatest possible danger.</p>

<p>This is how a fire in New Zealand has been described by
Mr. William Satchell:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>"For a while it seemed that the battle must go to the wind,
the fiery monster withdrew, lay hidden, roaring angrily in the
dry heart of the woods; then insidiously he stretched forth
his glittering arms, first one, then another, and locking the
shuddering trees in an irresistible embrace, sprang once again
erect. In an instant the whole bush from edge to edge
became a seething, rocking mass of flames.</p>

<p>"'Fire! Fire!'</p>

<p>"Then, insignificant no longer, transfigured rather beyond
all living possibilities of loveliness, the bush stood revealed
to its centre. It became less a fire than an incandescence,
waxing in brilliance to the point when, as it seemed, it must
perforce burst into indistinguishable flame. Every leaf and
twig of that fairy forest was wrought and hammered in virgin
gold, every branch and trunk was a carved miracle of burnished
copper. And from the golden leaves to the golden
floor, floatingly or swiftly, there fell an unceasing rain of
crimson flame petals, gorgeous flame fruits. Depth after
depth stood revealed, each transcending the last in loveliness.
And as the eye sought to penetrate those magic interiors
there seemed to open out yet farther vistas, beyond belief
beautiful, as of the streets of a city incorruptible, walled
and towered, lost in the light of a golden incomparable
star."</p>

<p>"'Fire! Fire!'</p>

<p>"In the face of that vision of glory the cry rang out with
all the ineptitude and inappropriateness of the human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
weakling. On one side the titanic forces of nature, inexorable,
eternal; on the other the man, frail of body, the
creature of an hour, matching himself against them.</p>

<p>"'Fire! Fire!'</p>

<p>"Sheltering his face from the insufferable heat, the Swede
hammered madly at the solid house-door. At the back, now
utterly unapproachable, the kitchen, the roof, and a part of
the main wall were already in flames. A few minutes&mdash;five
at the most&mdash;would complete the demolition of the house.
To right and left the great trees one after another went off
like rockets, the roar of their burning foliage shaking the
very earth. A deafening crashing of falling timber came at
intervals from the bush beyond."</p>

<p>In some countries the destruction of the forests has had a
very serious effect on the climate. The rain which falls upon
a forest is partly absorbed by the leaves, and but a very small
part of it is carried off by burns and streams: most sinks
down into the forest soil, and is only gradually given back
again after being taken in by the tree roots and evaporated
by the leaves.</p>

<p>But bare hills denuded of wood allow most of their rain to
rush down to the sea in dangerous spates of the rivers and
burns, and then the ground becomes afterwards very dry
and burnt up. There are very many countries now barren
and desolate because they have been robbed of the beautiful
forests which once covered the springheads and mountain
valleys.</p>

<p>Perhaps Palestine is one of the worst instances. But it is
when we remember Babylon, Nineveh, and all the cities of the
coast of Asia Minor, as they were even a thousand years
ago, and compare their present barren, desolate condition,
that the full meaning of mountain forests becomes clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Where once there were thriving, prosperous cities with
enormous populations, now the goats graze or a few miserable
peasants carefully husband the water of a few miserable
streams. The same thing has happened in Mauritius, in
the Cape Verde and Canary Islands, and in many other places.</p>

<p>But men are now beginning to see how dangerous the
destruction of forests may be, and in many countries and
especially in Britain, new forests are being planted. Perhaps
in time we may grow in Britain so much timber that we shall
gain something like £32,000,000 a year, which is what we
spend on imported woods.</p>

<p>At present plover, whaups, snipe, and grouse, or useless red
deer, inhabit what was once the Caledonian forest, and every
thousand acres of such land nowadays supports perhaps one
shepherd and half a gamekeeper. But when it is planted
again with woodlands it will afford a living to at least ten
foresters, and surely a whole gamekeeper as well.</p>

<p>In the lowlands of Scotland and in England one often
discovers, in walking over the hills, remains of cottages and
farmhouses which have now vanished. The people have
gone into the towns, and the healthy yeomen and farmers'
boys have become weak-chested factory hands and hooligans.
Such sites of old farms can often be recognized by a patch
of nettles, and especially by eight or nine ash trees. These
were always planted near the houses to give a ready supply
of wood for spears. The ash, "for nothing ill," as Spenser
puts it, would be available also for repairing the handles of
tools, carts, etc. Some authorities say that it was the law of
Scotland that these eight or nine ash trees should be planted
at every "farmtoon."</p>

<p>So also, when forests began to vanish in England, laws
were made to the effect that yew trees should be planted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
every village churchyard. Probably this was to ensure a
good supply of bows for the English archers, who, like the
Scottish spears, were the best soldiers of their kind in
Europe.</p>

<p class="smcap">A Forest Fire</p>
<p>Such fires frequently occur in New Zealand, and the Maoris have to fly for their lives.</p>
</div></div>

<p>So that if we try to compare the conditions of man and
of the forests in Great Britain from the earliest days, it
would be something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. When the earliest inhabitants lived on shell-fish, seabirds'
eggs, nuts, and fruits, almost the whole country was
covered by oak, Scotch fir, or birch forests.</p>

<p>2. When man was a hunter of reindeer and other deer,
horses, cattle, and birds, he used much wood for fires and
for building his lake dwellings.</p>

<p>3. When man kept herds of swine to eat acorns, black
cattle, goats, and ponies, there would be many clearings
and a great deal of open wood in which the cattle roamed
about.</p>

<p>4. When man grew corn and other plants, the forest
vanished altogether. Dr. Johnson said he scarcely saw a
tree between Carlisle and Edinburgh. Yet first the King,
then the Barons, had their parks and woodlands for preserving
game. Moreover, the yews in the churchyards of
England, and the ash trees by the Scotch farmtoons and
peel-towers, were carefully looked after.</p>

<p>5. When great towns arose, and men became factory hands
and steel workers, rich men began to make plantations in
the lowlands, and to use the depopulated highlands for
grouse moors and deer forests.</p>

<p>6. When men become wiser than they are now, it will be
seen that great forests are necessary on all waste-land and
barren places, both to keep a healthy country population
and because it will pay.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR many centuries flowers were considered as pleasing
and attractive decorations stuck about the world in
the same way as they are put in a drawing-room in
order to give people pleasure. Very soon they were found
to be extremely useful in poetry, sometimes to point a
moral or disguise a sermon, like the primrose in <i>Peter Bell</i>,
but more generally to produce a good impression on the
<span class="smcap">BELOVED OBJECT</span>. Burns puts the usual view of flowers very
nicely in the following: "But I will down yon river rove
amang the woods sae green, and a' to pu' a posie to my ain
dear May." Possibly this is the meaning also in the exquisite
lines of Shakespeare about the pansy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</div>
<div class="line i0h">It fell upon a little western flower,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line i0h">Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line i0h">And maidens call it, love-in-idleness."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Even if there is no particular meaning, the "little western
flower" gives point and beauty to the lines.</p>

<p>People only began to understand flowers about the year
1793, when Christian Conrad Sprengel, Rector of Spandau,
near Berlin, published a very interesting work. He had
discovered that the beauty of flowers and their colour and
shape were by no means intended solely to please <em>human</em>
eyes, but that they were designed to attract and allure the
eyes of <em>insects</em>. Before his time there had been many
guesses. Indeed, Theophrastus (born 371 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and often
mentioned in this work) seems to have quite well understood
why flowers produce pollen, and that the fruit would not set
and form seed unless pollen was carried to the female part of
the flower. He mentions that the Pistacio has both male
and female plants, and that Palms only form dates when the
pollen is carried to the female tree. This experiment with
the Date-palm was tried in 1592 by an Italian (Alpino)
in an Egyptian tour, and the Englishman, Jacob Bobart,
the Pole, Adam Zaluzianski (the latter in the same year) confirmed
the general idea. Then in the year 1694 Rudolp
Jacob Camerarius, a German, carried on a few more experiments,
but no real definite advance was made until 1793, in
the very midst of the French Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The great point of Sprengel's discovery was in its being
an intelligible explanation of the reason why flowers have
bright colours, scent, and honey. At his time and indeed
for many years afterwards, botanists looked on the stamens,
petals, and other parts of the flower exactly in the way that
a stamp collector looks at punctures and postmarks, that is
without thinking about their meaning. Now we find that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
they are always designed to fulfil a perfectly definite purpose,
and that all their details are contrived accordingly.</p>

<p>This purpose is to carry the pollen from the stamens of
one flower to the stigma of another. The pollen can usually
be recognized as a yellowish or reddish dust formed in the
stamens; this dust is generally rubbed off on an insect's
proboscis or on part of its body. When the insect reaches
another flower the pollen is scraped off by a sticky or
gummy stigmatic surface. When the pollen has been placed
on this surface it grows, germinates, and part of it unites
with the egg-cell of the young seed.</p>

<p>The latter is then, and not till then, able to become ripe
and mature. It may be compared to cross-breeding in
animals, though the process does not exactly correspond.</p>

<p>But all flowers do not require insects to carry their pollen.
In early geological periods we do not find any flowers like
those that now exist, nor in those early times were there
any flies, bees, or butterflies.</p>

<p>The cockroach seems to have existed in Silurian (whinstone)
times, and many gigantic and extraordinary insects
lived in those damp forests of ferns, club-moss, and horsetails,
of which the remains now form our British coalfields. Mayflies,
plantbugs, and especially dragonflies (some of them
with wings two feet across) existed, but none of these insects
are of much use as pollen-carriers.</p>

<p>Even much later on, when screw pines, monkey-puzzle trees,
ginkgos, and bamboos formed the forests and woods of
Europe, crickets and earwigs existed; but it is not until that
geological period in which the chalk was formed (the Cretaceous
age) that fossil plants like most of those now familiar
to us occur. These had flowers intended for insects, and
with the fossil plants we find the fossils of the insects that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
visited them. Bees, butterflies, and ordinary flies appeared
upon the scene just as soon as there were flowers ready for
them. Mr. Scudder has even found the fossils of certain
plants, and with them the fossils of butterflies closely allied
to the present butterflies which now live on present trees
allied to those fossils!</p>

<p>How then was the pollen of the first flowers carried?</p>

<p>It was in all probability blown by the wind or carried in
water. Even now poplars, alders, birches, and oaks rely chiefly
upon the wind to carry their pollen. These plants were
amongst the first of our modern flora to appear upon the
earth. Some of them possess very neat contrivances suited
to the wind. The catkins of the alder, for example, hang
downwards, so that each little male flower is protected from
rain by a little scale or bract above it. The pollen is very
light, dusty, or powdery, so as to fly a long distance. The
Scotch fir (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus sylvestris</i>) has male flowers in little cones.
These are upright, and the pollen of each stamen drops on
to a small hollow on the top of the stamen below. It is
then blown away by the wind on a fine dry day, but it is not
allowed to get out in wet weather. It is said that vast
clouds of pine pollen occur in America, and that the water
of certain lakes becomes quite yellow and discoloured by it
at certain seasons. Each little particle of pollen has two
minute caps or air-balloons which give it buoyancy, so that
it can float easily immense distances.</p>

<p>A curious little herb, the Wall Pellitory, and another
foreign species, the Artillery plant, produces small explosions
of pollen. When it is touched, there is a little puff or
cloud of dusty pollen. Even the common Nettle does the
same on fine dry days when it is in full flower.</p>

<p>But of course this carrying of pollen by the wind is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
very expensive arrangement. It is so much a matter of pure
chance that a grain arrives at its right destination. Suppose
that a flower is giving out clouds of pollen, then the
chance of a pollen grain reaching a female flower only five feet
away is very small, even if the stigma of the female flower
is a quarter of an inch in diameter. The chance of pollen
reaching it will only be about 1 to 1440; 1439 pollen
grains will be wasted<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> for every one that reaches the stigma.
But even this is not quite a fair calculation, for if the female
flower is not down wind, none will reach it at all!</p>

<p>But if an insect goes to the catkin of an alder or any
other male flower, it will see the red points of the stigma
and will very likely go there at once. This shows how
much more reasonable and efficient insects will be.</p>

<p>The immense majority of flowers are, in fact, purple, blue,
red, yellow, or white, so that they are conspicuous, and stand
clearly out against the green of their leaves. It is well
known to all who have arranged flowers for the table that
the green of the leaves of different plants varies greatly in
its shade and tint. Many greens do not match special
flowers at all, but it is the fact that the green of any one
plant is always quite harmonious, and agrees well with its
own flowers!</p>

<p>Besides varied and beautiful colours, sweet or strong scents
and supplies of honey or nectar are provided for insects.</p>

<p>How did flowers manage to produce all these attractions?
No one has answered that question. We know in a general
sort of way that the parts of flowers are modified leaves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
that petals and stamens become yellowish or pure white
because they do not form green colouring matter like
ordinary leaves.</p>

<p>It is also known that on the Alps or on any high mountain,
where the air is pure and the sun strong, flowers
become rich, brilliant, and vivid. In such places as the
"Jardin" near Mont Blanc, the pure, deep, rich blue of
gentians, the crimsons, reds, and purples of other flowers,
impress the most casual and unobservant traveller. "White
and red, yellow and blue, brown and green stand side by
side on a hand's breadth of space." In that strong mountain
air, also, perfumes are stronger, purer, and of finer quality
than in the lowlands. There is a more intense, active, and
vigorous life going on in flowers than is required by
the more prosaic industries in other parts of a plant.
Flowers also often live at a higher temperature than the
surrounding air.</p>

<p>Kerner has described how the little flowers of Soldanella
penetrate the snow by actually melting a passage for themselves
through it (see p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>).</p>

<p>This high temperature and vigorous life, shown also by
the rapid transpiration of flowers,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> seems to hint that
colours and perfumes appear in consequence of rapid chemical
transformations.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>It was, of course, by degrees that the extraordinary variation
in colour, which exists in nature, came about. No
doubt bees, bumble-bees, wasps, and the more intelligent
flies were improved and developed æsthetically. We can
almost tell by looking at a flower what sort of insect probably
visits it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Not only so, but there are the neatest imaginable contrasts
and blends of colour. The common Bluebeard Salvia, e.g.,
has the uppermost leaves (three-quarters to an inch long) of
a deep, rich, blue-purple, which the roving Bumble-bee will
see from a long way off. The Bumble-bee flies to this great
splash of her favourite hue and for a second buzzes angrily,
then she notes the small <em>bright-blue</em> patches on the upper
lips of the small flowers below the leaves which are set off by
<em>white</em> hairs of the upper and <em>yellow</em> hairs of the lower lip.</p>

<p>That bees really do understand and are guided by colour
may be gathered from the following unfortunate accident.
A certain hive of bees which had been brought up in a blue-striped
skep became accidentally scattered. They tried to find
their way back to their old home, but many strayed, and it
was noticed that they had tried to enter the doors of every
blue hive, which were strewn with the bodies of the unfortunate
intruders.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The rich blue-purple of Aconite, the dark strong red of
the Woundwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stachys silvatica</i>) are specially beloved by
bumble-bees and hive-bees. Butterflies like any bright colour.
Those flies which have a long, sucking proboscis, resemble
the bees in their tastes, but all these insects are quite capable
of finding out where they can get honey most easily, and
visit flowers whatever the colour may be.</p>

<p>A very strange and wonderful fact is that quite a number
of plants prefer the dark, or rather the dim, mysterious light
of the gloaming. Then the Honeysuckle, the Evening
Campion, the Night-scented Stock, Tobacco, and Schizopetalon
give out their strongest scent and open out their white flowers
as widely as possible. That is because they wish to attract
the owlet moth and others which come out at this time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
when there are fewer enemies and more security. If you
look at any of these moth-flowers at mid-day, they are for
the most part closed up, they are not particularly attractive,
and they are giving out very little scent. The contrast to
their condition in the evening is most striking.</p>

<p>Not only insects but birds are used to carry pollen. The
gorgeous little humming birds, with their brilliant metallic
crimson, bronze-green, and purple, are of the greatest
importance in the New World. In the Old World they are
replaced by the tiny <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nectarinidæ</i> or Sunbirds, with breastplates
almost as exquisitely jewelled. They prefer the most
gorgeous reds and scarlets, such as that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salvia horminum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lobelia cardinalis</i>, and the like. Fuchsias are regularly
visited by them in Tierra del Fuego, where sometimes they
may be seen busily at work during a shower of snow. In
South Africa they seize the stem of a Redhot Poker (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tritoma</i>)
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Kniphofia macowanii</i>), and twisting their little heads round,
they suck the honey from every blossom in succession. Still
more interesting it is to see them perched on the edge of one
of those great tumbler-like heads of Protea (e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. incompta</i>)
and dipping their slender curved beaks repeatedly into the
flowers. Then the little male bird will alight on a branch
and make the most elaborate preparation for a song of
triumph. Although helped out by fluttering of wings and
much display of feathers and tail, the song is a very faint
cheep of the feeblest description, and very difficult to hear.</p>

<p>Not only birds but even animals are sometimes called into
the service. There is a group of small mammals which live
on the honey of flowers. Even the Kangaroo is said to
occasionally take a draught of nectar from some of the cup-like
flowers of the Australian Dryandra (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proteaceae</i>).</p>

<p>But one of the most interesting and extraordinary facts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
is the manner in which flowers fit in. They begin early in
the morning: one blossom opens out and then another; all
endeavouring to catch the attention of some passing insect.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Allionia violacea</i> opens at three or four a.m., and closes about
eleven or twelve. Some wild Roses open about four or
five in the morning, as well as the Chicory, Roemeria, etc.
Virginian Spiderwort, Dandelion, and Nightshade are ready
at six in the morning. A great many (Buttercups, White
Water Lily, etc.) are open by seven a.m. Most of these
early flowers are shut at noon. Others begin to close about
three or four in the afternoon. The regular evening moth-flowers
open about six p.m., though <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cactus grandiflorus</i> does
not open till nine or ten p.m., and closes at midnight.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Extraordinary as these variations seem, they are easily
explained. Some open early because there are then few
competitors. By far the greater number are open from nine
a.m. till one or two p.m., because those hours are the favourite
working time of most insects.</p>

<p>Flowers live for very different periods. That of the Wheat
only lasts for fifteen or twenty minutes (its pollen is carried
by wind), and is then over. There are others, Hibiscus and
Calandrinia, which only remain open for three or four hours,
but a Foxglove will last six days, a Cyclamen ten days,
whilst Orchids may last for from thirty to eighty days
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypripedium villosum</i>, seventy days, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odontoglossum Rossii</i>,
eighty days).</p>

<p>Thus the sun every day through the summer, as he calls
into life new swarms of insects, sees at every hour of the day
new flowers opening their petals to his genial warmth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
ready for the new bees and flies. The development of the
flower and that of its insect are probably simultaneous, and
equally regulated by the sun's warmth. Moreover the opening
periods do not merely fit in during the day, but each
flower has its own special month, and even in Scotland there
is no month in which some flower may not be found in bloom.
Any stray wandering insect can get its draught of honey at
any season of the year.</p>

<p>This is a matter of some importance for those who keep
bees, and the following list may be of some use. <em>February</em>:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crocus vernus</i>, Snowdrop, Black Hellebore, and Hazel.
<em>March</em>: The preceding, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arabis alpina</i>, Bulbocodium,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cornus mascula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helleborus f&oelig;tidus</i>, Giant Coltsfoot, Gooseberry,
various species of Prunus and Pyrus, Willow. <em>April</em>:
The preceding as well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adonis vernalis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Barbarea vulgaris</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brassica napus</i>.</p>

<p>It is not worth while noting those that bloom from May
to September, for there are hundreds of good bee-flowers in
these months. In <em>October</em>: Borage, Echium, Sunflowers,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lycium europæum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malope grandiflora</i>, Catmint, Tobacco,
Ocimum, Origanum, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phacelia tanacetifolia</i>, and others.
Most of these last into November.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In December and
January very few plants are in bloom. The following
have been noted at Edinburgh Botanical Gardens: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dondia
epipactis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tussilago fragrans</i>, Snowdrop, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geum aureum</i>,
Hepatica, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primula acaulis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. veris</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aubrietia deltoidea</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crocus imperati</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. suaveolens</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erica herbacea alba</i>, Helleborus
(3 species), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polygala chamaebuxus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Andromeda floribunda</i>;
also Sir H. Maxwell<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> mentions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Azara integrifolia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hamamelis</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arborea</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chimonanthus fragrans</i>. Of wild plants, Chickweed,
Whin or Furze, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lamium purpureum</i>, and Dandelion
can generally be found in the depth of winter.</p>

<p>The contrivances which can be found in flowers, and by
which the insect is forced to enter exactly along the proper
path, are endless. Each flower has some little peculiarity of
its own which can only be understood by thoroughly examining
the plant itself. It is not therefore possible to do justice
to the ingenuity of flowers in a work of this sort. There are
orchids which throw their insect visitors into a bath of water,
so that they have to crawl with wet wings up a certain path
where they touch the pollen masses and stigma; others
which hurl their pollen masses at the visitor. In the Asclepiads
a groove is provided into which the leg of the insect
slips, so that it has to struggle to get its foot out, and must
carry off the pollen masses, though it often fails and leaves
its leg behind. Some Arums and Aristolochias have large
traps in which they imprison the insects, and only let them go
when they are sure to be pollen-dusted. In one of these
flowers there are transparent spots on the large petal-prison,
which so attract the insects that they remain opposite them
instead of flying out (just as flies do on a window-pane).
Salvia has a stamen which is like a see-saw on a support;
the bee has to lift up one end, which brings the other with
its pollen flat down on to its back. The Barberry has a
sensitive spot on its stamen; when the insect touches the
spot, the stamen springs up suddenly and showers pollen
upon it. In Mimulus the two flaps of the stigma close up as
soon as they are touched, which will be when they have
scraped off any pollen; then when the creature withdraws,
covered with the flower's own pollen, none of this can be left
on its own stigma, as this is shut up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
But instead of reading, one should watch a bumble-bee
visiting the Foxglove flowers. The sight of her busily
thrusting her great hairy body into the bell, which almost
exactly fits her shape, while she gurgles with satisfaction,
will teach the reader far more about the romance of flowers
than many pages of description. If he then carefully examines
the flower, he will see how the honey, the arched
converging stamens, and the style, are placed exactly in the
right place and where they will have the most effect.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>One orchid, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Angraecum sesquipedale</i>, has a spur eighteen
inches long, and the great Darwin suggested that there must
be an insect somewhere with a tube long enough to reach the
honey. Such an insect, a large moth, was actually brought
home from Madagascar, the place where this orchid occurs,
after a lapse of many years!</p>

<p>Perhaps more remarkable than anything else are such cases
as the Yucca and the Yucca-moth or the Fig-wasp and the
Fig.</p>

<p>The Yucca is a fine lily-like plant resembling the Aloes in
general appearance. A particular sort of moth lives entirely
upon the Yucca. When the flowers open, the mother-moth
kneads up a ball of pollen and places an egg inside. This
ball she thrusts down the style into the ovary of the flower.
There a grub develops from the egg and eats the pollen, yet
some of this pollen fertilizes the young seeds. If Yuccas
died out the moth would be exterminated. If the moths
were destroyed, no Yuccas would ever set their seed!</p>

<p>The Fig has two sorts of flower. The one (caprifig)
produces only male or pollen-yielding flowers. The other is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the true edible fig. Inside the caprifig are the grubs of the
fig-wasp, which rejoice in the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blastophaga grossorum</i>.
When grown up these force their way out of the caprifig
and, flying to the true fig, the mother-wasp lays her eggs in
certain flowers which have been apparently specially modified
for the purpose. At the same time she covers the ordinary
flowers with pollen from the caprifig. Her progeny return
to the caprifig. Here again the future of a valuable fruit-tree
is absolutely bound up with the fortunes of a tiny and
in no way attractive wasp!</p>

<p>Another very remarkable case is that of those flowers
(Stapelia, etc.), which in colour and general marking closely
resemble decaying meat or other objectionable substances.
Very often the smell of such flowers is exceedingly strong, and
resembles the ordinary smell of putrid matter. In one case
an artist employed to paint the flower had to use a glass
bell, which was put over it. He could only lift it for a
second or two at intervals in order to see the exact colour,
before the horrible odour obliged him to cover it over again.
Blowflies and others, which are in the habit of resorting to
such substances, seek out these flowers in great numbers and
lay their eggs upon them. In so doing they carry the pollen.</p>

<p>There are certain fungi which have quite as horrible a
smell, and some of them also resemble decaying animal
matter. These are most eagerly sought out by the same
blow-and other flies (bright green lucilias, yellow-brown
scatophagas, bluebottles, etc.). But in the case of these fungi
it is the spores, not pollen, which is carried by the insect.</p>

<p>The effect of this flowery sort of life is abundantly evident
in the structure of the insects themselves. Their mouth has
been most wonderfully modified into a complex sucking
apparatus; their legs have been transformed to act as pollen-carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
baskets, and the habits and tastes of the insects have
been modified in the most extraordinary way.</p>

<p>Perhaps also the association of bright colours with a very
pleasant sensation&mdash;that of a full, satisfying meal&mdash;has
raised the artistic sensibilities of butterflies, sunbirds, humming
birds, etc. For certainly these flower-haunting birds
and butterflies are remarkable for their brilliant colouring.
This has probably been brought about by the preference of
the females for the most brilliantly coloured male butterflies
and humming birds.</p>

<p>At any rate bright reds and blues are common to both
bird or insect and to the flowers that they frequent. But
the most curious point of this whole question lies in the fact
that human beings of all grades, South Sea Islanders, the
Ancient Greeks, Peruvians, Japanese, Romans, as well as the
Parisians and Londoners of to-day, appreciate the beauty of
colouring and grace of form which are so obvious in the
world of flowers.</p>

<p>Yet man has had nothing whatever to do with the
selection of either these colours or shapes. Many of those
which he considers most precious (such as the weird, spotted,
and outlandish Orchids of Madagascar and South America)
have very likely scarcely ever been seen by man at all. It is
to the artistic eye of the honey-bee, bumble-bee, butterfly,
and of the humming bird and sunbird, that we owe these
exquisite colours. The grace and beauty of outline probably
depend upon their perfect symmetry and on the perfect
suitability of every curve to its purpose.</p>

<p>Therefore it seems that the eyes of man, whether savage or
civilized, are pleased and comforted by these same colours
that delight the little brains of insects and birds.</p>

<p>This is indeed a mysterious fact.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE word "Adam" means red earth. Poets and
essayists still regularly write about Mother-Earth
and, in so doing, admit one of the most interesting
and wonderful facts in Nature.</p>

<p>If you go to some quarry or cliff where a section has been
cut, laying bare the original rock below; then (with Hugh
Miller) you may reflect on the extraordinary value of those
few inches of soil which support the growth of all our trees
and of all our cultivated plants.</p>

<p>It is probable that plant-roots <em>never</em> go deeper than about
thirty feet. All our food, our energy, and activity depend
therefore on this thinnest surface-layer of an earth which is
8000 miles in diameter. But in most places the depth of
true soil is far less than thirty feet, generally it is not more
than thirty inches, and by far the most valuable part of it is
a very thin layer five or six inches thick.</p>

<p>It is in this true soil that the roots gain their nourishment,
and not only roots, for whole populations of worms, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
germs, of insects, even of birds and the higher animals, live
upon it. To it return the dead leaves, the bodies of dead
insects, and waste products of all kinds. Within it, they
are broken to pieces and worked up again by the roots of
other plants in order to form new leaves, new insects, and
food for bird and beast. Just as in engine-works, you may
see old engines, wheels, and scrap-iron being smashed into
pieces; they are melted down and again worked up into
engines of some improved design.</p>

<div><a name="thrashing_corn_in_chile" id="thrashing_corn_in_chile"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="smcap">Thrashing Corn in Chile</p>
<p>Mares are driven at the gallop round the circle, and so beat the corn out of the ear with their hoofs. They do this for
twenty minutes at a time, and are then made to go the other way round.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On a chalk-cliff, which dates from the long-distant Cretaceous
period, the entire thickness formed by the yearly
work of plants for millions and millions of years is often less
than a foot in depth, and probably only four to five inches
are true soil.</p>

<p>But this is an exceptionally thin stratum, although it is
capable of producing rich turf, fat snails, and excellent
mutton. In peat-mosses and in those buried forests which
form the coalfields, vegetable matter may accumulate in
deposits of thirty feet of coal. Yet these stores of carbonaceous
matter seem to be at first sight miserly and selfish,
at least from a vegetable point of view.</p>

<p>They resemble the gold and silver withdrawn from
circulation in the world by some Hindoo miser and buried
deep within the earth. Yet somebody is pretty certain to
find out and make use of such stores eventually.</p>

<p>In the case of the peat and coalfields, an animal of
sufficient intelligence to utilize them has already been produced,
and now they are used by man as fuel.</p>

<p>It is very important to remember that the soil is a sort of
last home to which the particles of carbon, of nitrate, and
minerals always return after their wanderings in the bodies
of plants, of insects, or of other animals. They probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
rest but a short time before they again set off on new
adventures.</p>

<p>One might say the same of the water, and of the carbonic
acid gas and oxygen of the atmosphere, for the water, falling
as rain upon the earth, trickles down to the underground
water-level. Then it immediately begins to rise up between
the particles of earth and is promptly caught and
sucked in by the roots, only to be again given out by their
leaves. The carbonic acid gas and oxygen also are always
entering and leaving the foliage. Even the nitrogen of the
air is not left alone in the atmosphere. There are small
germs in the soil which are able to get hold of it and make
it into valuable nitrates.</p>

<p>More curious still is the fact that electric charges can be
used to change the comparatively useless air-nitrogen into
useful manures. Probably the farmer will some day make
his own nitrates by electricity.</p>

<p>The structure of the soil or earth is a most interesting
and romantic part of botany. It is true that a "radical"
disposition is necessary if one is to go to the root of the
matter, but, unless we do this, it is impossible to realize the
romance of roots.</p>

<p>Down below is the unaltered rock, sand, or clay. Next
above it comes the subsoil, which consists of fragments of
the rock below, or of sand, clay, etc., more or less altered by
deep-going roots. Even in this subsoil, bacteria or germs
may be at work, and the burrows of worms and insects often
extend to it. Next above the subsoil comes the true soil;
there is plenty of the stones, soil, sand, or whatever it may
be that constitutes the subsoil, but its richness consists in
its contents of valuable minerals, and especially of broken-up
leaves, corpses of insects, and manure. Above this true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
soil are first the leaf-mould of two years ago, then that of
the year before last, and <em>on the top</em> is the leaf-mould and
other decayed products of last winter.</p>

<p>All these upper layers are full of life and activity, which
probably goes on vigorously all the year round.</p>

<p>The population of worms is especially important. The
worm is a voracious and gluttonous creature: it is for ever
swallowing bits of leaves and rich soil. Inside its body
there are lime-glands which act upon the vegetable food and
improve its quality as manure. The worm comes up to the
surface at night or early morning and leaves the worm-casts
upon it. The rain then washes the rich, finely-divided
matter of the casts down into the soil again. It is said
that there are about 160,000 worms at work in an acre of
good soil. Yet their life is full of danger. A keen-eyed
population of blackbirds, thrushes, starlings, peewits (plover),
and partridges are always watching for and preying upon
the poor worm. Even in his burrows, which may be six feet
deep, he is not safe, for the mole (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">moudiewarp</i>) is also both
very hungry and very active, and delights in eating him.</p>

<p>In the soil also and even deeper in the subsoil are many
insects; some hibernate in the winter, and at other times
actively gnaw the roots of plants or devour dead leaves and
twigs (see Chapter xxiii.). Thus there are many burrows and
holes, so that there is no want of air in the soil, which
is indeed necessary both for these creatures and also for the
roots of the plants.</p>

<p>Rain comes down through the soil, carrying with it carbonic
acid, mineral salts, and also germs or bacteria, which
form perhaps the most important population of all.</p>

<p>No work could be carried on without their help; it is
bacteria which, at every stage of decay, assist in breaking up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
leaves, twigs, insects' bodies, worm-casts, and other manures.
The way in which they work is too difficult to explain here,
but to get an idea of the romance of the underground world
one must try to picture to oneself these swarms and myriads
of germs and bacteria all incessantly and busily engaged at
their several duties. In the uppermost layers there are probably
in a single cubic inch of good soil from 54,000,000 to
400,000,000 of these microbes. Many are absolutely
necessary to the harvest; a few may be of little importance,
but there are sure to be some of those dangerous sorts which
might devastate a continent with disease in a single summer.</p>

<p>There are also quantities of other fungi. The fairy rings
which one sees year after year in widening circles of bright,
fresh green are the work, not of fairy footsteps, but of an
underground fungus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Marasmius oreades</i> and others). Its
threads are thin, white, and delicate; they attack the roots
of grasses, etc., on the outer side of the ring. It is therefore
on this outer side yellow, dry, and more or less withered.
On the inner side, however, the grass is luxuriant and of a
rich bright green. Here the fungus has died off, and its
remains, as well as those of the plants which it destroyed,
form a rich manure for the new grass following on its track.
Every year the ring widens; at a certain time in summer one
sees the irregular line of mushroom-like fungi which are
formed by the destructive underground absorbing threads.
This, however, is but one of the underground fungi. There
are many kinds; some are useful, others are very destructive.</p>

<p>Upon the upper surface of the soil there falls not only
rain, but another sort of rain consisting of seeds, dead
leaves, insects' bodies, fungus spores, bacteria, and dust.</p>

<p>Every year when the ploughman turns the sod there is a
revolution in the whole of these populations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
So far nothing has been said about the roots themselves,
which penetrate, explore, and exploit all these layers of dead
leaves, soil, and subsoil.</p>

<p>The length of roots produced is very much greater than
any one would suppose. A one-year-old Scotch fir seedling
when grown in sand produced in a season a total length
(branches, etc.) of no less than thirty-six feet of root. The
total surface of this root system was estimated to be about
twenty-three square inches. This little Scotch fir after six
months' growth was laying under contribution a cone of
earth twenty to thirty inches deep and with a surface of 222
square inches. In certain kinds of corn the same author
estimated the total length of the roots as from 1500 to 1800
feet. S. Clark estimated the length of the roots of a large
cucumber plant as amounting to 25,000 yards (fifteen miles),
and made out that it was occupying a whole cubic yard of
ground.</p>

<p>Clover roots are said to go down to depths of six or nine
feet, but many weeds go deeper still. Coltsfoot, for instance,
may be found, according to a friend of mine, living at a
depth of twenty spades. In Egypt and other places the roots
of acacias go down to twenty feet or even further, so that
they can tap the water supplies, which are at a great depth.</p>

<p>But a still more extraordinary fact is the manner in which
the root-branches arrange to grow in such a way that they
search every part of the soil.</p>

<p>The main root in many plants grows straight down, or as
nearly as it can do so. Its branches are inclined downwards
at a quite definite angle which is often 30°-45° to the surface.
Moreover, these branches come off in quite a regular way.
Each keeps growing in its own special direction to the east,
south-east, or west, or whatever it may be, of its parent root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Have they some extraordinary sense of the direction of
the points of the compass? It is said that if a side root,
which is growing, say for instance downwards and westwards,
is turned in some other direction, it will after a
time resume its original westerly voyage. This fact is a
most extraordinary one, if true, but it can scarcely be said
that it has been proved, and, as will be shown later, there are
other curious facts in the behaviour of roots which might
explain the experiment without assuming that roots know
the points of the compass.</p>

<p>If one cuts a branch of willow and plants it upside down
in the earth, it will very likely take root and grow. Its appearance
will be most extraordinary, for the roots will grow
downwards, whilst the branches, instead of growing in the
direction of the old branches, turn round and grow upwards.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Why do roots generally grow downwards? The fact is so
familiar that the difficulty of answering does not, at first
sight, seem so great as it really is.</p>

<p>Pfeffer, the great physiologist, has the following interesting
comparison. Suppose a man is trying to find his way in the
dark, then a single lingering ray of light gives him an impulse
to walk towards it.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> So our root, also in the dark,
feels the pull of gravity and endeavours to grow downwards.
Others have compared the direction of gravity to the
sailor's compass, and suppose that the root is guided in the
same sort of way.</p>

<p>But a young, vigorous root making or forcing its way in
darkness through stones and heavy earth is a most interesting
and fascinating study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
There are the most extraordinary coincidences in its
behaviour. It has the property of always doing exactly the
right thing in any emergency.</p>

<p>It is of course intended to keep below the ground and in
the dark. So we find that if roots are uncovered, they will
turn away from the light and burrow into the earth again.
They avoid light just as a worm would do.</p>

<p>Roots are of course intended to absorb or suck in water.
If there is a drain in the soil or a place where water collects,
the roots will grow towards that place. Very often they
form a dense spongy mass of fibres which may almost choke
the drain. Along a riverside one can often find great fibrous
masses of tree roots near the water. But how does the root
learn that the water is there and turn away from its original
track to find it? It certainly does so!</p>

<p>Then again, Herr Lilienfeld has recently shown that roots
seem able to turn away from poisonous materials in the soil
and to seek out and grow towards valuable and nutritious
substances. He found that peas, beans, sunflower, and other
roots were very sensitive to different substances in the soil,
and were directly attracted by what was good for them and
turned aside from what was unwholesome.</p>

<p>This property and the power of growing towards water
probably explain the mysterious sense of direction alluded
to above, for roots will take a line which has not been
exhausted by their neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>But of all these wonderful properties, the most remarkable
is the way in which roots find their way past stones and
other obstacles in the soil. They insinuate themselves into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
winding cracks and crawl round stones with an ingenuity
that makes one wonder if they can possibly be without some
sort of intelligence.</p>

<p>It is the very tip or end of the young root that seems to
be responsible; for if, in the course of its journeyings underground,
it should strike a stone or something hard, the root
does not grow on and flatten itself.</p>

<p>But some sort of message is sent back from the tip to the
growing part which is a short distance behind it. After
this message has been received, the growing part begins to
curve sideways, so that the tip is brought clear of the obstacle
and can probably proceed triumphantly upon its way. The
inexplicable part is that the growing part which curves has
never been touched at all, but simply answers to the message
from the tip.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>This is perhaps the most reasonable and intelligent behaviour
found in the whole vegetable world, and it is not
surprising that Darwin compared the root-tip to a brain.</p>

<p>These extraordinary responses fill one with astonishment,
but there are others still more interesting and remarkable.
It will be remembered that we have already shown how
different the soil is at different levels. The subsoil, soil, and
uppermost layers are all quite different from one another.</p>

<p>This may explain why it is that many plants seem to
prefer to develop their roots at one particular depth below
the surface. Not only so, but they find their own favourite
level in the most persevering way.</p>

<p>If, for instance, you sow a barley-corn at too great a
depth, the seed germinates and forms a few roots, but it immediately
sends out a stem which grows upwards towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
light. As soon as this stem has reached the proper place,
which is just below the surface, there is an enormous development
of roots, which begin to search and explore their
favourite stratum of soil.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In some few cases one can see in a dim sort of way the
reason for the level which certain plants prefer. Thus
the underground stems of the common Thistle, which are
very long and fleshy, are found just a few inches below the
level usually reached by plough or spade. This makes it
very difficult to tear them out. Even if grubbers with long
spikes which reach as deep as these buried stems are driven
through the ground, it generally happens that the stems are
only cut in pieces and not dragged up. These hardy weeds
are not much injured by little accidents of this kind, for each
separate bit will form upright thistle stems next year. In
fact if one cuts this fleshy subterranean runner of the Thistle
into pieces a quarter of an inch long, each piece will probably
become a Thistle.</p>

<p>Sometimes indeed these weeds are carried from one field to
another by pieces of them sticking in the very machines
which are used to eradicate them.</p>

<p>The Bishopsweed is one of the hardest cases. The writer
was once ambitious enough to try to dig up an entire plant
of this horrid weed. The first foot or so revealed no sign of
the end of the branching runners, and it was not until a hole
about four feet deep and five feet across had been excavated
that there was any sign of an end to the plant.</p>

<p>When it was at last removed, the original deeply buried
stem was found to give off branches which again branched in
a most complicated manner, until almost every green shoot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Bishopsweed<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> within a space six feet in diameter was seen to
be really a branch of this one original plant! So to eradicate
the plant it would have been necessary to dig over the whole
garden to a depth of at least five or six feet.</p>

<p>How did the stem get down to such a depth below the
surface? This is one of the most curious stories in plant
life, and the process which we shall now try to describe has
only been explained within the last few years.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The seed of the Wild Garlic (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Allium ursinum</i>) lies at
first upon the surface of the ground, but it is soon buried by
a growth of the stalk of the seed-leaf, which pushes the germ
down below the earth. As soon as it is buried, roots are
formed and pass obliquely downwards, where they become
fixed by forming root-hairs all round themselves. These
root-hairs round every root hold its tip firmly in the earth;
then these same roots contract or shorten, which of course
hauls down the root a little deeper in the earth. One might
compare it to a few men hauling down a balloon by ropes
attached to the car. About September to November, roots
of quite a different character are formed; these explore the
surrounding soil and gather in food and moisture.</p>

<p>Then the roots rest during the winter, when the buds and
young leaves are being formed. In April the buds begin to
push out their leaves and a new ring of roots appear. These
April roots are quite different from the September ones.
They again fix themselves firmly and then contract, becoming
fully a third shorter than they were originally. The bulb is
dragged down still deeper below the surface. It flowers in
May and fruits in June and July. Then in September the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
same series of operations begins again. The process
goes on until the plant is three to five inches below the
ground.</p>

<p>It follows from all this, that every year the roots find new
ground to explore and utilize. Nor is the Wild Garlic at all
exceptional in this respect. A great many plants have roots
which contract and drag the bulb or stem after them deeper
into the earth. Something of the same sort happens, for instance,
to Bramble branches. They arch or droop over, when
growing, so that the end touches the earth. On the underside
of the tip, as soon as it begins to rest on the ground,
roots are formed. These roots make their way into the
ground, and then, when fixed, they shorten or contract, so that
the end of the branch is dragged down to a depth of several
inches. After this has happened the old branch generally
dies away, and a young, vigorous Bramble develops from its
buried tip.</p>

<p>Raspberry branches also are often buried; their roots
become coiled or rolled in a very curious manner. The end
of the root becomes firmly attached in the soil, and then the
rest of it revolves like a tendril so as to draw the stem
deeper into the earth.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>On any ordinary roadside in the country one is sure to
find the rosettes of the common Dandelion and of the Rats-tail
Plantain (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plantago major</i>). These are two of the most
interesting plants in the world, although they are vulgarly
common. How is it that their leaves are always at the level
of the ground? The stem is always growing upwards;
every year fresh circles of leaves are formed above the older
ones. Yet the crown of the stem is never so much raised up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
above the ground that the toe of a boot would be likely to
knock it off. It is always kept so deep in the earth, that it
is by no means easy to kick or "howk" the crown out of the
ground.</p>

<p>The Dandelion root contracts very strongly at the end of
the season, and by this shortening or contraction keeps its
leaves just at the soil level. The Plantain sends out about
forty to sixty oblique downward-growing roots, which fix
themselves in the soil by throwing out branch roots. These
forty to sixty roots are at first about ten inches long, but, as
soon as they are firmly attached, they contract, and pull
the stem with its crown of leaves about one-third of an inch
deeper. This is just enough to keep the leaves flat on the
ground and to prevent any possible injury from passers-by.</p>

<p>So that in finding their favourite level in the soil, plants
are often pulled or hauled about by the roots. But they
are not always moved by the roots. Even though buried in
darkness, they seem able in some way to tell when they are
in the most favourable position.</p>

<p>Every gardener knows that Autumn Crocus and other
bulbs do not remain in the same position. They wander
below ground in a curious and inexplicable fashion.</p>

<p>The Solomon's Seal has an underground, fleshy stem,
which prefers to grow at a definite depth. If it is planted
close to the surface, then the point of the next year's little
fleshy bud turns downwards; next year it again turns downwards,
and so on every year, until the stem has reached its
proper depth. Then it grows horizontally. Similarly, if it
is planted too deep it grows upwards.</p>

<p>Thus if one wishes to realize the underground life of
plants, one must picture to oneself:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The usual descending roots, whose system of branching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
may be compared to the ordinary branching above ground.
It is often not unlike the reflection in water of the tree
itself, such as one might see on a fine winter's day along the
shore of some still lake.</p>

<p>2. The bold, exploring, horizontal runners of Couchgrass,
Thistle, Bishopsweed, etc., vigorously pushing their way at
a depth too great for the gardener's spade.</p>

<p>The water evaporating on the surface of the soil must,
as it rises from the permanent water-level below, pass the
gauntlet of all these thirsty rootlets and their hairs. Tree-roots
will be ready to intercept it at ten feet depth, many
herbaceous plants will suck it in at depths of five to six feet,
and in the upper layers of soil it will have to pass root-system
after root-system from Asparagus to Paris, so that
very little will be lost.</p>

<p>Perhaps of more importance are the bacteria-germs, and
dissolved mineral salts in the rainwater as it trickles down
from the surface. The soil particle acts as a filter: at every
inch of the descent some of the bacteria and salts will be
left, so that by the time the level of Asparagus has been
reached there will be exceedingly few, and the water is comparatively
speaking pure. The effect of this vigorous underground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
life is often visible on the surface. Roots, and
particularly tree-roots, are often extraordinarily strong.
Kerner, in his invaluable <cite>Natural History of Plants</cite>, has a
beautiful picture of a young larch tree which had grown in
a fissure of a huge boulder.</p>

<p>In attempting to grow, the root had forced up part of this
stone. It was estimated that it had lifted a weight of
3000 lb., though it was only some ten inches in diameter.</p>

<p>Along a dry-stone wall, or even near houses, the growth of
tree-roots very often damages the entire wall, which may be
entirely overthrown if the tree is too near. The force of the
growth of the roots is so great that even a six-foot stone
wall cannot keep them down.</p>

<p>Quite a young seedling root, in forcing itself through the
soil, may exercise a pressure of two-thirds to four-fifths of a
pound!</p>

<p>This is of course necessary, if one remembers that it has
to drive itself through the earth, pushing aside and compressing
the earth particles along its course.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is impossible to understand and very difficult to explain
the sort of life and consciousness which is enjoyed by
plants.</p>

<p>That they do live is obvious; we know instinctively that
they enjoy fine weather in summer and gentle showers in
spring, but we cannot prove it.</p>

<p>Much of a plant's life is concealed and hidden from us.
Even the few explanations which have been given by certain
observers are by no means generally accepted.</p>

<p>This is true even as regards the case of the Cherry tree,
which has been experimented with, and fought over and
argued about by botanists, and yet we only know a very
little about its inner life.</p>

<p>When the leaves fall in autumn, next season's buds are
already formed and are then about one-eighth of their
full size. At this time the tree contains enormous quantities
of food-stores, for the whole season's work of the leaves has
been accumulating until this moment. During the long
winter's "sleep" the tree is by no means at rest. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
arranging and packing up those stores in the safest place and
in the most convenient form.</p>

<p>Just as a bear, before it retires to sleep during the winter,
takes care to get as fat as possible, so the Cherry turns its
starch to fat, and stores it away in the innermost and least
exposed parts of the tree, that is in the central wood. As
soon as the winter ends, and indeed <em>before</em> it has ended, preparations
are beginning for the great moment of the year.
For weeks there is a slow, gradual, almost imperceptible
growth of the buds, then they develop with a rush, and in six
to ten days double or treble their weight. Then comes the
supreme moment, for the flower-buds suddenly burst open
and the Cherry is in active and vigorous bloom and covered
all over with exquisite blossoms. All last year's fats and
starches are rapidly used up. Very soon the young leaves
are beginning to make sugar and other food, which give some
help during the ripening of the fruit.</p>

<p>The flowers are actively at work. One of our usual misconceptions
as to the nature of a flower is that it is an emblem
of peace, of restful enjoyment, of serene contemplation
of its own beauty. That is very far from being the truth.
The petals are actively, vigorously working. If one could
take the pulse of a petal, which shows the rapidity of its
breathing, one would find that it is twice as fast as that of
the leaf. The work of changing water into vapour and
pouring it out goes on three times as quickly in the petals
(as compared with the leaves). Moreover their temperature
is higher, and often distinctly above that of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>This feverish activity of the flowers themselves is matched
by the hurrying crowds of excited and exhilarated insects
which are searching every blossom.</p>

<p>No wonder that the Japanese Prime Minister, in the midst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of their great and famous war, invited the whole cabinet to
spend an afternoon watching the cherry trees in bloom!</p>

<div><a name="wistaria_in_kamaido_park_japan" id="wistaria_in_kamaido_park_japan"></a></div>

<p>From the blossom of the springtime all through summer
and autumn follows one continuous spell of hard work. Day
after day an endless stream of food is entering the stem;
night after night it is condensed and arranged and repacked,
until, when the leaves fall, the period of slow and quiet preparation
begins again.</p>

<p>Under certain conditions it is possible for gardeners to
modify the life of a cherry, and to make it bloom much
earlier, but this is only possible within well-defined limits. It
is no use trying to force it to bloom before January. It <em>must</em>
have a quiet time after summer. But by beginning in January
and by very carefully managing the temperature, it can
be made to produce fruit quite early in the year.</p>

<p>The following account is given to show how very carefully
gardeners have to work when they upset the ordinary course
of Nature's events. The plant is taken into a greenhouse,
and the temperature kept as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Not merely strong, forcing heat, but a little judicious cold,
is necessary to get out the flowers and to ripen the fruit.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Most flowers have very much the same general history as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the cherry, but it must not be supposed that they are all
alike. The differences are very interesting and curious.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, plants of our common Gorse, furze, or
whin may be found in bloom at almost every season of the
year. There are at least four seasons when there is that
tremendous display of golden blossom which made the great
Linnæus fall on his knees and burst into tears. These are
about the 22nd March, 24th May, 15th August, and
21st November; yet there are enough odd flowers blooming
in almost every month to give some cause for the saying,
"The gorse is out of bloom when kissing is out of favour."
The last practice, though uncleanly and dangerous, not only
on general grounds, but on account of bacterial germs which
may be transferred, has been authoritatively condemned in
the United States, but it is still more or less popular in
other countries at all seasons.</p>

<p>The Chickweed and some other of our annual weeds show
a hardy disregard of climate. Its seeds germinate and grow
at any time, so that flowers and seeds can be formed whenever
there is a spell of favourable weather. Now one chickweed
can produce 3000 seeds. Suppose that there are only
five generations in the year, which is a very low estimate.
Then one seed of chickweed might produce 3000 × 3000 ×
3000 × 3000 individuals in one season!</p>

<p>Other plants show much the same tendency. In fine
warm autumns a great many annuals bloom a second time.
It is on record that forty-four spring species bloomed in one
warm November. At the Cape and in other warm climates
many of our annuals do not die at the end of autumn, but
go on growing. They become perennial.</p>

<p>It is even possible to make a Tree Mignonette by pinching
off the flower-buds, though this plant is usually an annual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
In fact plants are not absolutely confined to one rigid
scheme, but they can alter and modify their blooming time
if they find it convenient to do so. In the Mediterranean
some blossom in early spring and others in late autumn,
whilst in the dry, hot, and dusty summer very few flower.</p>

<p>In Central Africa during the dry season forest fires are by
no means rare. The trees are scattered, and the ground is
only covered by dried and withered grasses and sedges. One
sees in the distance a rolling cloud of smoke, and soon one
comes to a line of flame. It is not dangerous, not even very
impressive, for a jump of three feet carries you over the
flame and on to a desolate wilderness of black cinders, out of
which stand up the scorched trunks and half-burnt branches
of gaunt, naked trees. A day or two afterwards, bright blue
and white and yellow flowers break out of those scorched
branches and also from the ground.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why this happens, but certainly
it is good for the flowers, which can be seen by insects
from a long distance.</p>

<p>But these are unusual cases. Generally the warm breath
of spring wakes up the bulbs and buds, and one after another
has its moment of flowering.</p>

<p>Spring travels towards the North Pole at an average rate
of four miles a day.</p>

<p>A pedestrian visiting Italy in the end of January might
follow the spring northwards, and if he wished to accompany
it all the way, it would be quite possible to do so without
exceeding an ordinary day's march. He would have to
reach North Germany by the end of March, Sweden in May,
and by the end of June and July would find spring beginning
in the desolate Arctic regions.</p>

<p>Of course the presence of mountains would make this tour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
a little difficult and devious, but still it is quite a possible
undertaking. It would be very interesting, for he would be
able to watch the cold and frost and chilliness of winter
disappearing as the sun's rays thaw out a greater and
greater extent of the cold and frozen North.</p>

<p>The life of an Arctic plant is truly set in the midst of
many and great dangers.</p>

<p>For 250 days the ground is hard frozen and the temperature
<em>never</em> above the freezing-point. About the end of
May it begins to rise a little, but the plant has to crowd the
whole of its life, its flowers, fruits, and seeds, into the space
of two months!</p>

<p>About the 23rd to the 29th June the first flower appears,
then follows strong, active growth in uninterrupted sunshine
during July and August. The flowers are brilliant in colour
and richly produced. The tiny dwarf Arctic plants are
covered all over with blue or golden yellow or white blossoms.
All is in full activity and luxuriance. Then suddenly, in a
night, the icy grasp of winter falls upon them.</p>

<p>Hard-frozen flowers, buds, and ripening fruits remain
chilled and incapable of life from the 30th August until the
end of May.</p>

<p>Of course, under such conditions, these hardy and vigorous
little plants cannot become trees or shrubs. To show the
effect of the climate upon them, a few British plants which
are also Arctic may be compared.</p>

These wretched little dwarfs seem, however, to have pretty
long lives, and, as we have said, deck themselves in the most
gaudy colours every summer.</p>

<p>In the Alps of Switzerland and other temperate countries,
the flowering season is also a very short one and soon over.
It is often not more than six weeks, yet in that short time
the rich blue of the Gentian, the Alpine Roses, Soldanellas,
Campanulas, and many others make some of these grass slopes
high up in the mountains a perfect garden of loveliness.</p>

<p>Sometimes in passing over the snowfields of Switzerland
just before spring, one notices the pretty violet flowers of the
Soldanella swaying to and fro in the wind above the unmelted
snow. One does occasionally see in this country the
Snowdrop in the midst of snow, but then it has fallen after
the Snowdrop had blossomed.</p>

<p>The Alpine Soldanella flowers whilst the earth is still
covered. It begins as soon as the ground below the snow
is thawed. Each little developing flower-stalk melts out a
grotto in the snow above itself, and so bores, thawing its way
up into the air above. It has already been mentioned that,
inside a flower, the temperature is often higher than the
surrounding air. It is this higher temperature of the flower
which thaws a little dome or grotto in the snow above the
head of the flower.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> When a flock of sheep are covered by
a snowdrift, a similar hollow is formed above them by their
breath and the high temperature of their bodies: they often
seem indeed to be little or none the worse for being buried.
The Soldanella melts its way in just the same manner.</p>

<p>In this country we have no such magnificent chain of
mountains as the Alps, and yet we find on the Scotch and
Welsh mountains quite a number of real alpines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
There are, for instance, such flowers as Sea-pink (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armeria</i>),
Sea Plantain (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plantago maritima</i>), Scurvy-grass, and others,
which can be found on windy, desolate gullies and corries
high up on the Highland hills, and which also occur on the
sea-coast, but <em>never between the seashore and the tops of the
mountains</em>. You might search every field, every moor, and
every riverside throughout the country, but you would not
discover those three plants anywhere between the seashore
and the summits.</p>

<p>At first sight it seems quite impossible to explain why this
should be the case. But all those three plants are found in the
Arctic regions, and the explanation is in reality quite simple.</p>

<p>At one time the shores of England and Scotland formed
part of the Arctic regions. Ice and snow covered the hills
and mountains; huge glaciers occupied the valleys and
flowed over the lowlands, plastering the low grounds with
clay which they dragged underneath them, and polishing
and scratching any exposed rocks.</p>

<p>When the ice began to melt away and left free "berg
battered beaches" and "boulder-hatched hills," Lincolnshire
and Yorkshire must have been like the Antarctic regions in
those days. This is how Dr. Louis Bernacchi describes the
Antarctic continent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The scene before us looked inexpressibly desolate....
No token of vitality anywhere, nothing to be seen on the
steep slopes of the mountains but rock and ice.... Gravel
and pebbles were heaped up in mounds and ridges. In some
places these ridges coalesced so as to form basin-shaped
hollows. Bleached remains of thousands of penguins were
scattered all over the platform, mostly young birds that had
succumbed to the severity of the climate."</p>

<p>Great Britain must have been just as savage and desolate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
when these hardy little Arctic plants colonized the shingles
and rooted themselves amongst the rocks.</p>

<p>They covered not only the seashore, but they probably
made a settlement wherever rock or land of any kind was
exposed. These original settlers have had three bands of
descendants. One band has remained ever since on the seashore
of Great Britain; another set gradually travelled
northwards. As the ice melted away, leaving the land bare,
first in Denmark, then in Norway, and finally in Greenland,
this second set followed it, until now we find them far to the
northward, populating the Arctic regions of to-day just as they
did those of Britain in the Great Ice Age.</p>

<p>The third set of descendants would at first cover all the
land and rocks of the lower hills and valleys near the sea;
then as the ice and snow melted and exposed the higher
mountain sides, they would climb the hills and eventually
reach the exposed summits where they are now living. There
they find themselves in an impossible, savage sort of climate,
in which they alone are able to exist. Violent storms,
drenching mist, scorching sunshine (when the rocks become
so hot that it is almost impossible to touch them), rainstorms
and months of snow and hard frost, cannot kill Scurvy-grass,
Seathrift, or Plantain, but there are few other plants
which can stand such conditions. Lower down on the flanks
of the hills and in the valleys, they have long since been dispossessed
of the rich and fertile lands by plants which can
grow more rapidly and luxuriantly.</p>

<p>The little Alpine Creeping and Least Willows, for instance,
some of which get up to 3980 feet in Breadalbane, are mere
dwarfs only a few inches high, and totally different from
their allies in the fertile lowlands, which are trees eighty to
ninety feet high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Some of the Alpine plants which also occur in the Arctic
regions have not even been able to survive by the seaside in
Great Britain. Their nearest allies are in the Norwegian
mountains.</p>

<p>It would be impossible even for shrubs to stand the violent
winds and snowstorms of these summits. Alpine plants are
generally low-growing mats. They are also often clothed all
over in cottonwool, such as the Edelweiss. This probably
keeps them from losing too much water during the dry
season, when the rocks on which they grow are strongly
heated by the sunlight.</p>

<p>Yet, like the Arctic plants, they have rich, deep, and
brilliant colours.</p>

<p>A queer point is that they have got so accustomed to this
stormy and perilous existence that it is extremely difficult to
grow them in a garden. Like mountaineers, they dwindle
and pine away in the richer soil and softer air of the low
grounds.</p>

<p>To make an Alpine garden, rocks and stones must be
arranged with pockets and hollows, like natural crevices and
basins, between them. Rich leaf-mould must be placed in
these hollows. There must be good drainage, and as much
sunlight as one can possibly get.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> scrub or Half-desert does not seem at first sight to be
in the least interesting.</p>

<p>But if one remembers such places as Cordoba,
Seville, Florence, Genoa, Sicily, Athens, Constantinople, the
great cities of Ephesus, Corinth, etc., of St. Paul's Epistles,
Persia, Arabia, Palestine, and Carthage, surely the countries
which have had such splendid histories deserve a chapter to
themselves. What achievements in war, in art, in literature,
and in romance are connected with these lands bordering the
Mediterranean or fringing the great deserts of Sahara and
central Asia!</p>

<p>The animals which belong to such country are also
interesting. It is the home of the camel, ass, horse,
donkey, not to speak of the giraffe, rhinoceros, gazelle,
antelope, zebra, lion, and hyena.</p>

<p>The plants are full of interest too, and some of them are
of great importance to man. The Olive, Orange, Fig, Roses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
and many perfumes and spice-trees, are natives of scrub. In
fact, it is the real centre of all gums, frankincenses, and
myrrhs.</p>

<p>As man depends upon plants and animals, and as animals
also are dependent on the plant world, it is the climate
which really is responsible for everything.</p>

<p>The world of plants is entirely and exactly regulated by
the character of the climate. What, then, is the climate of
scrub?</p>

<p>Those countries enjoy brilliant sunshine, cloudless skies,
and yet there is sufficient rain to permit of irrigation and to
prevent the unmitigated desolation of the desert. When, as
has happened in many of these famous lands, the forests
have been cut down and the aqueducts have been neglected,
they become arid, dry, and almost useless. But when carefully
and industriously worked, as they were in the days of
Greece, Carthage, and Rome, they produce results which will
for ever live in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The meaning of such half-desert climates and of the scrub
which covers them has been already suggested.</p>

<p>The scrub is trying to occupy the desert.</p>

<p>If one takes the sternwheel steamer at the First Cataract of
the Nile and passes southwards, the desolation of black rock
and "honey-coloured" sand of the Libyan Desert is at
first unbroken. But here and there the thorny trees of the
"Seyal". Acacia show the beginnings of a scrub region.
Much further to the south, those acacias and others become
great forests which extend all along the south of the Sahara
Desert and furnish the valuable gums of the Soudan.</p>

<p>If one passes southward through this forest of acacias, it
alters in character. The trees become taller, closer together,
and climbing plants and undergrowth become more frequent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Still further south, one finds the regular tropical forest
which is characteristic of the tropics everywhere.</p>

<div><a name="gathering_olives_in_the_south_of_france" id="gathering_olives_in_the_south_of_france"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p class="right"><i>Photo G. F.</i></p>
<p class="smcap">Gathering Olives in the South of France</p>
</div></div>

<p>The most interesting part, which is also the richest in big
game, is the intermediate zone between the desert and the
acacia forest or scrub.</p>

<p>All sorts of transitions are found. Sometimes there are
thickets of thorny bushes. Occasionally scattered clumps of
woodland alternate with stretches of grass or what looks like
grass. Near the desert one finds pioneer acacias dotted singly
here and there; these are the scouts or skirmishers of the army
of trees which is trying to occupy and colonize the desert.</p>

<p>This explains why this sort of scrub occurs in so many
parts of the world. On the European side of the Mediterranean,
the dry climate of Spain, the Riviera, and Greece
must no doubt at one time have supported a scrub vegetation.
At present it is difficult to tell what this was. There
is a sort of scrub called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maqui</i> which covers parts especially
of Corsica and other Mediterranean countries. In Greece,
also, thorny, woody little bushes are very common.</p>

<p>But these are just what the goats, who are fiends from a
vegetable point of view, have been unable to destroy. We
cannot tell what sort of country revealed itself to the first
Ph&oelig;nicians when they landed in Southern Spain to traffic
with the savage inhabitants, or what met the eyes of
Ulysses when he made his great voyage to unknown lands.</p>

<p>But there are places in the world where man has never
either kept domestic animals or cultivated the soil. Possibly
Spain and Sicily in those early days were not unlike parts of
British East Africa, such as the Taru Desert between Mombasa
and Kibwezi.</p>

<p>The following may give an idea of how this scrub or desert
appeared to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Gnarled and twisted acacias of all sorts and sizes, usually
with bright white bark and a thin, naked appearance, cover
the whole country. Amongst these one finds the curious
<em>trees</em> of Euphorbia. In Britain Euphorbias are little green
uninteresting weeds, but here some of them are twenty to
thirty feet high, with many slender whip-like branches, but
no leaves. Others are exactly like Cactus, and take on weird,
candelabra-like shapes. Nobody meddles with them for, if
the slightest cut is made in the bark, out pours an acrid,
white milk which raises painful blisters, and may even cause
blindness if a drop touches the eyes.</p>

<p>Almost all the plants are either covered with thorns or
protected by resins, gums, or poisonous secretions.</p>

<p>Between the scrubby trees the soil is dotted over by little
tufts of grass or sedge, but these are so far apart that the
tint of the landscape is that of the soil.</p>

<p>Game is abundant everywhere. Sometimes it is a small
bustard or a persistent, raucous guinea-fowl that affords a
chance for a good dinner. Occasionally a tiny gazelle, the
"paa," with large ears, springs out of the thorns and
vanishes down the path. I saw footprints of giraffes, and
came across ostriches more than once. I also made a persevering
attempt to slay a Clarke's gazelle, an animal with
enormous ears and a long thin neck.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>These long-necked creatures can see far above the usual
short thorny bush, and it is exceeding difficult to get near
them. Water probably exists under the stony grit soil, but
at present one has to be contented with that found in the
stagnant pools at Taru, Maungu, etc., which, if not occupied
by the decaying remains of a dead antelope, are, as a rule,
drinkable.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
These acacias are quite well fitted to live in this dry and
arid region. Their roots go down to twenty feet or more,
so as to reach the deep-seated water supplies.</p>

<p>Their leaves are generally adapted to resist any injury
from the strong glare of the sunshine. The gums, already
alluded to, are also very important, for any crack or break
in the tree is promptly gummed up, and there is no loss of
precious water thereby. This gum will also prevent or discourage
burrowing and boring insects from getting in; they
would, if they tried to do so, become "flies in amber," like
those found in fossil resin. The trees are generally provided
with strong spines, which guard them from the many
grazing animals which try to devour the succulent leaflets.</p>

<p>The fight between the grazing animal and the plant is, in
these scrubs and half-deserts, very severe. In Egypt it is
said that the whole flora has been entirely altered by the
camel and the donkey.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>But in this case the battle is unfair. Man keeps those
camels, donkeys, and goats. He provides them with water
and protects them from lions, leopards, and snakes. In East
Africa man has not yet interfered, and the plants probably
get the better of the animals. In such places lions, leopards,
and hyenas are common. It will be remembered that a lion
not very long ago stormed and took charge of a railway
station on the line to Uganda, and was only routed with
very heavy loss.</p>

<p>There is also some reason to suppose that the antelopes
and other creatures do help the plants in their efforts to
colonize the Sahara. Their droppings will very greatly improve
the soil, and more vigorous thickets and undergrowth
will spring up when the soil is improved in this way. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
a vigorous growth of plants will be better able to resist the
long eight or nine months' drought, and so help the wood to
develop, until perhaps it is too thick, and the trees are too
high, for the antelopes to graze upon them. In this manner
the Acacia scrub is slowly and painfully colonizing the
desert.</p>

<p>It is not only in Africa that one finds these half-deserts or
scrub. There is the Brigalow Scrub in Australia, which has
a curious silver-grey shimmering appearance on account of
the blue-grey sickle-like leaves of the Brigalow Acacia.
The foliage casts no shade, for the leaves are flat and thin,
and place themselves edgewise to the light, so that there is
no danger of the strong light injuring them. Also in
Australia is the Mallee Scrub, covering thousands of square
miles between the Murray River and the coast. It consists
of bushy Eucalyptus, six to twelve feet high. Its
monotonous appearance when seen from a small hill is very
striking.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> "Below lies an endless sea of yellow-brown bushes:
perhaps far away one may observe the blue outline of some
solitary hill or granite peak, but otherwise nothing breaks
the monotonous dark-brown horizon. Everything is silent
and motionless save perhaps where the scrub-hen utters its
complaining cry, or when the wind rustles the stiff eucalyptus
twigs."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>There is a melancholy interest attaching to both the
Mallee and Brigalow, for in them lie the bones of many
gallant and persevering explorers. Nor is the East African
thorn-tree desert without its victims. The missionary, Dr.
Chalmers, was lost near Kibwezi in the Taru Desert.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Egyptian Queen Hataru's Expedition</p>
<p>The ships of the expedition are drawn up along the shores of Punt (in Somaliland), and incense trees are being carried on board.
Notice the baboons on board ship, and the rays and sword-fish in the water.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are a certain number of valuable plants found in
these half-deserts or scrubs. Perhaps the earliest geographical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
expedition of which we have a good account (with
illustrations) is that sent by the Egyptian Queen, Hatasu,
from Thebes, about three thousand years ago. She built on
the Red Sea a fleet of five ships, each able to carry from
fifty to seventy people, and sent them to the land of Punt,
which was probably Somaliland. The natives lived in round
huts built on piles like the ancient lake dwellings. The
object of the journey was to obtain incense. No less than
thirty-one incense-bushes were dug up with as much earth as
possible about their roots, and carried to the ships, where
they were placed upright on the deck and covered with an
awning to keep off the sun's rays. Whether they did really
survive the journey and grow in Egypt is uncertain. Sacks
of resin, ebony, cassia, apes, baboons, dogs, leopard-skins,
and slaves, as well as gold and silver, were also taken away.
The Queen of Punt accompanied them. From her appearance
it is not probable that the Queen of Sheba was any
relation, although some writers have supposed that Sheba
and Punt were the same place.</p>

<p>The whole story is represented in coloured bas-reliefs in
the temple at Tel-el-Bahiri, near Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The incense here alluded to was a very valuable drug in
Egypt on account of its use in embalming mummies. Quite
a number of gums, resins, and the like, are obtained from
Somaliland and similar half-desert countries. The frankincense
of the Bible, which may be the incense of Hatasu, is
obtained from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Olibanum</i> produced by various species of
Boswellia. In February and March, cuts are made by the
incense gatherers in the bark of the trees. Tears of resin
soon appear and become dried by the sun over the wound.
The best kinds still come from Saba, in Arabia, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Romans obtained it in the time of Virgil. Besides Olibanum,
frankincense contains Galbanum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferula galbaniflua</i>)
and Storax (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Storax officinale</i>). Equal parts of these were
mixed with the horny shield of a certain shell-fish. When
the last is burnt, it has a strong pungent odour. The Galbanum
is now found in Persia, and Storax in Asia Minor,
both half-desert countries. The true Myrrh (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commiphora
myrrha</i>) is also found in East Africa and South-west
Arabia.</p>

<p>The name is supposed to be derived from Myrrha, the
daughter of Cinyras, King of Cyprus, who in consequence
of a great crime was banished to Arabia and became the
tree which bears her name. The myrrh of the Sacred
Oracles was used as incense at least 3700 years ago, and it
is mentioned by Moses (Genesis xxxvii. 25).</p>

<p>The sovereign of England used always to present gold,
frankincense, and myrrh in the Chapel Royal, London, on
the feast of the Epiphany, and, strange though it may
appear, the symbolic offering is still made each year by our
present king.</p>

<p>Balm of Gilead (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balsamodendron Gileadense</i>) belongs to
scrub or half-desert regions. Cleopatra obtained plants
from Jericho for her garden at Heliopolis. The Jews used
to sell it regularly to the merchants of Tyre.</p>

<p>It is still valuable, for the essence is worth from £2 to
£3 per lb.</p>

<p>The opoponax described by Dioscorides belongs to the
Orient. It yields a valuable gum resin, which is much used
in perfumery (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pastinaca opoponax</i>). It also is obtained by
incisions in the bark<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of the tree.</p>

<p>In fact a very large proportion of these fragrant sweet-smelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
substances, Myrrh, Cassia, Bdellium, etc., come
from these sunny Eastern lands, which are not exactly
deserts but very close to them. Manna, e.g., is obtained from
the flowering Ash (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fraxinus ormus</i>) in Sicily by transverse
incisions being made in the bark, so that the brownish or
yellowish viscid juice exudes and hardens on the wound.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ladanum</i> is a varnish or gluey coating found on the leaves of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cistus creticus</i>, which grows in Crete. In old times the glue
was collected from the beards of the goats which had been
browsing on the plant. Although this method, no doubt,
increased the strength of the perfume, it has been abandoned,
and the ladanum is obtained by a "kind of rake with a
double row of long leathern straps." The straps take the
glue from the leaves. It is used as a perfume in Turkey.</p>

<p>Another very interesting Eastern plant sometimes seen in
old-fashioned country gardens in Britain is the "Burning-bush"
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dictamnus fraxinella</i>). Like a great many of these
half-desert plants, it is full of an acrid, ethereal, odorous
substance. On a calm, hot summer's day, this material
exudes from the leaves and surrounds the plant with an
invisible vaporous atmosphere. Such an atmosphere probably
assists in preventing the water from evaporating or
being transpired from the leaves.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Now if one places a lighted match a little below the leaves
or flowers this vapour catches fire, and there is a display
of flames and smoke with little explosions, followed by a
strong smell. The plant may be injured if it is set on fire
too frequently, but generally does not seem to be any the
worse for the experiment.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean is the home of the Myrtle and Olive,
of Oranges and Lemons, of Figs and Vines, of Almonds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Raisins, as well as of many other important and interesting
plants.</p>

<p>The olive crop in Italy yields about ninety millions of
gallons of olive-oil every year. The olives are collected as
soon as they become ripe, and are crushed in circular stone
troughs with a perpendicular millstone. The paste is then
pressed in bags and afterwards clarified by passing through
cotton wool.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> To the eye of a foreigner the white gnarled
stems and silver-green foliage of the olive groves are not
particularly attractive.</p>

<p>Near Burriana, in Spain, one may walk for miles through
the plantations of oranges. The dark-green glossy leaves
and golden fruit of the orange make a most beautiful contrast,
but the dry, thirsty soil, and the careful way in which
the water is regulated and supplied by small gutters, most
jealously watched over, make the tourist realize the difficulty
of agriculture in so dry and arid a country.</p>

<p>The Myrtle is not a very important plant nowadays,
though its berries are still eaten and myrtle wreaths used to
be worn by the bride at every wedding. In classical times
it was sacred to Venus, but the victors in the Olympian
games were also crowned with myrtle, and the magistrates at
Athens had the same privilege. It is no longer used as a
medicine and for making wine. It is really a native of
Persia, but has been introduced to the Levant, Italy, France,
and Spain.</p>

<p>It is along the Riviera that one finds a very curious and
interesting industry. This is the manufacture of perfumes
and essences from the petals of flowers. A great many
different flowers are used, such as the Garden Violet, Mignonette
(a native of Egypt imported in 1752), Lily of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Valley, Tuberose, "the sweetest flower for scent that grows,"
Jonquil (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus jonquilla</i>), Heliotrope (imported from
Peru in 1757), Spanish Jasmine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. grandiflorum</i>), which is
a native of Nepaul, and was brought to Europe in 1629, and
various Roses.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>These Roses have had a long, interesting, and honourable
history. No one knows when they were first cultivated.
Solomon had his rose-gardens at Jericho. Queen Cleopatra
spent some £400 on roses in one day, and Nero is said to
have beaten this record by wasting 4,000,000 sesterces
(£30,000) in roses for a single banquet.</p>

<p>Rosewater is said to have been first produced by an Arab
physician called Rhazés in the tenth century. When Sultan
Saladin recovered Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187, the
pavement and walls of the Mosque of Omar were washed and
purified with rosewater. That stout warrior Thibault IV,
Count de Brie et de Champagne, brought back roses from
Damascus on his return to his native land. That was the
origin of the valuable Provence roses. The Lancastrians
chose a Provence rose as their badge at the beginning of
the Civil Wars of the Roses in England.</p>

<p>Otto of Roses, or the essential oil, was discovered by Princess
Nour Jehan at the court of the Great Mogul, and she
received as her reward a pearl necklace worth 30,000 rupees.
The price of otto of roses seems to have been about £320
per pound in Persia and India when the traveller Tavernier
visited those countries in 1616.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, peers of France
had to present bouquets and crowns of roses to the assembled
Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
At present there are very important rose plantations in
France,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Bulgaria,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and in the Fayoum in Egypt. In France
about ten or twelve thousand roses are grown on two and a
half acres. The season is from April to May. Women
gather from twenty to twenty-five pounds daily, and obtain
from twopence to threepence for two and a half pounds.
Each tree will give about a quarter of a pound of roses.
The petals are distilled to make rosewater.</p>

<p>Some 12,000 people on the slopes of the Balkans, at
Kerzanlik and other places, entirely depend upon their rose
plantations. These are on light soil, fully exposed to the
sun, at over 1200 feet above the sea. It is interesting to
find that the pure mountain air strengthens the perfume, for
these Balkan roses are fifty per cent. richer in essences than
those of lowland plants.</p>

<p>Another interesting plant much cultivated in the Riviera
is the Cassier (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acacia farnesiana</i>). It is really a native of
India, but was introduced from the West Indies to Europe in
1656. Cannes, Grasse, Antibes, and Nice are the places
where it is most cultivated. Its flowers appear from July to
November. An old tree may yield as much as twelve to
twenty pounds of flowers, worth about five to six francs. But
116 pounds of flowers only yield about a pound of essence,
so that it is not surprising that this last is worth £60 the
pound.</p>

<p>The cultivation is a little uncertain, for a temperature of
three or four degrees below the freezing-point kills the
trees.</p>

<p>The pomades made from many of these flowers are produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
as follows: A series of trays are covered with fat or
grease; the petals are placed on the grease and replaced by
fresh petals every twenty-four hours or so; in the end the
grease is so saturated with scent that it forms pomade or
pomatum.</p>

<p>Thus these half-desert countries are by no means without
interest from a botanical point of view. The conditions of
life are no doubt hard both for plants and animals. The
scent so richly produced depends upon the strong sunlight
and pure air. It is very useful, partly because it attracts
those useful insects which carry the pollen, but also because
such odours are distasteful to grazing animals. The gums,
incenses, thorns, and spines are all of great use to the plant
in its dangerous struggle for existence with hungry camels
and thirsty soil.</p>

<p>When men understood how to irrigate the soil, and before
they were foolish enough to cut down the forests which once
guarded the mountain springs, these half-deserts were exceedingly
prosperous; they were full of vigorous intellectual
life, and of strong, hardy, and industrious peoples. Asia
Minor, Turkey, Greece, and the Northern Coast of Africa
from Morocco to Egypt, were rich and wonderful countries.</p>

<p>But it was not only the destruction of the forests that has
ruined them. The curse of Mohammed, the fatalism produced
by his religion, and the slavery which is a necessary part
thereof, have destroyed the people in mind, body, and spirit.
Even in Greece, Algiers, and Cyprus there has been as yet
but small recovery.</p>

<p>In the future, not merely these countries, but Northern
Nigeria, British East Africa, and South-west Cape Colony,
may have as rich a history as Greece, if British brain and
energy are helped by the strong muscles of the African.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N every day throughout the year English people
drink about 600,000 lb. of tea. That is about 270
tons, which would form, when made into the beverage,
a lake quite large enough to float a man-of-war! No
other civilized nation takes its tea in the reckless way that
we do. Yet our fellow-subjects in Australia drink even
more than ourselves.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of this tea is grown in British colonies
or possessions, manufactured by British subjects, and imported
in British ships.</p>

<p>The coolies who work in the tea-gardens of Assam and
Ceylon, the Englishman who manages them, the engineers in
Glasgow and Newcastle who made the machinery, the shipbuilders,
shipowners, and crews, are all fellow-countrymen of
those who drink the cup that cheers. Every sixpence in the
£8,000,000, which is our yearly account for tea, finds its
way into the pockets of our fellow-subjects either at home or
abroad.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Every one would suppose that a trade like this, which
benefits everybody, would be very carefully fostered by
Government.</p>

<p>Far from it, for this is one of those articles that are
always being attacked by Chancellors of the Exchequer, who
seem to have a special ill will against tea.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is so heavily taxed that it is extremely difficult
to make a profit on tea-gardens. Elsewhere in this chapter
some other very curious facts will be found illustrating the
extraordinary habits and methods of the British Government.</p>

<p>The author does not try to explain these facts, but only
points them out; a nation that can manage to exist at all
when such things are done by its Government is a nation to
which one is proud to belong.</p>

<p>The Tea-plant is a native of China and Assam. It is a
very handsome shrub resembling a camellia, with dark,
glossy, green leaves and beautiful flowers. It is said to have
been used in China about 2700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and the first plantations
in India were made with Chinese seed. But a Mr. Bruce
reported the presence of an indigenous wild tea in Assam.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Three botanists who were sent to investigate the question
suggested that this Assam variety was only the Chinese plant
run wild, and advised the introduction of Chinese seedlings.
This was a very unfortunate mistake, for the wild Assam
plant gives much better results.</p>

<p>The jungle is first cut down and cleared away by the
native tribes, with the help of elephants. Then at the right
season, i.e. after the rains begin, the Indian women and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
coolies go into the plantations. They carry on their backs a
basket supported by a band across the forehead. These
women nip off the first two leaves and a bud with their
finger and thumb and throw them into the basket over their
shoulders. When the basket is full they take it back to the
factory, where their gatherings are weighed. The actual
manufacture is, in India and Ceylon, all performed by
machinery. The tea is first emptied on to trays in a shallow
layer: a pound of tea when so spread out covers more than
a square yard. These trays are then placed in a room which
is heated to a high temperature, for "withering." After six
hours it is passed through a machine which "rolls" or gives
a twist to the leaves. It is then "fermented" on cement
floors, where the tea is covered by strips of moist muslin. It
is again rolled and afterwards dried or "fired." The sifting
out of the different sorts or blends, and also the packing of
the tea in chests, are done by machinery.</p>

<p>That is the Indian system of manufacture, in which there
is scarcely any hand-labour.</p>

<p>In China the rolling, and indeed every stage of the process,
appears to be done by hand. It is obvious that in the handling,
pattings, and rollings of the tea by Chinese coolies,
"celestial moisture" may be imparted to it. In spite of
this, however, the export of Chinese tea is steadily diminishing.
In the old days, the Liverpool "tea clippers," fast and
beautiful sailing-ships, raced each other home from China in
order to get the first tea upon the market.</p>

<p>Tea is sometimes dangerous, and especially when it is
allowed to stew on the fire for hours at a time. Besides
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">theine</i>, which is the stimulating, active part of it, and which
is a bracing tonic to the nerves, <i>tannin</i> is also found therein.
When meat is taken with a large amount of <i>tannin</i>, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
latter acts on the meat exactly as it does on hides in a tanning
factory. It forms a substance resembling leather, which
taxes the powers of the strongest digestion.</p>

<p>Once upon a time in those fertile mountains of Abyssinia
which have never yet been explored by the white man, there
was a very holy and pious hermit. He used to live entirely
on the milk of a few goats which he carefully tended with
his own hands. One morning he noticed that one of these
goats showed signs of unusual excitement. It was frisking
about, and obviously was exceedingly well pleased with
itself.</p>

<p>That was not a usual experience with the holy recluse, who
watched the animal carefully. He soon discovered that it
was in the habit of grazing on the bright red berries of a
very handsome shrub in the hills. The anchorite tasted
those fruits and discovered that he also became both pleased
with himself and somewhat excited.</p>

<p>His disciples soon discovered a brightness and exhilaration,
an unusual "snap," in the good man's sermons, and they
watched him and also discovered <em>Coffee</em>!</p>

<p>The author refuses to take the responsibility of more than
the discovery of the above story. Coffee was, however,
introduced into Arabia by the Sheikh Dabhani in 1470. It
was taken to Constantinople about 1554, and about a hundred
years later coffee-houses and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cafés</i> were regular and
habitual daily resorts in London and Paris.</p>

<p>As usual with stimulants of all kinds, the watchful eye of
a moral Government discovered something objectionable in
coffee, and Charles II in 1675 imposed heavy taxes, or rather
forbade the use of it altogether.</p>

<p>There was in 1718 a coffee-plant in the botanical gardens
at Amsterdam, and in that year some of its seeds were sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
to Surinam, in Dutch Guiana. Apparently the millions
of shrubs in the enormous coffee plantations of the New
World are all descended from this particular Amsterdam
plant.</p>

<p>This New World coffee is by far the most important
supply. Brazil alone exports about £19,000,000 worth of
coffee, and that from the New World forms about 82 per
cent of the total world's production.</p>

<p>The story of coffee in Ceylon is a tragedy. There happened
to be in the jungle a particular fungus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemileia vastatrix</i>)
which got its living on the leaves of wild plants belonging to
the coffee order (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubiaceæ</i>) and others. When Arabian
coffee was introduced, the fungus began to attack its leaves.
The result was the utter ruin of the industry. It is said
that about £15,000,000 was lost by this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemileia</i> disease in
Ceylon.</p>

<p>The plantations require a great deal of care. The shrubs
have to be carefully pruned, and the preparation of the
coffee bean is not a very easy matter. It is really the seed of
a bright red, fleshy berry. The pulp or flesh has to be removed,
and also both a horny skin, the "parchment," and a
thin delicate membrane, the "silverskin," in which the seed
is enclosed. Coffee is not nearly so much used in Britain as
in some other places, and particularly in Holland, for the
Dutch drink about twenty-one pounds per head in the year,
whilst we in Great Britain only use about three-quarters of
a pound.</p>

<p>It is in fact not very easy to make good coffee, and it is
absolutely necessary to grind and roast the beans just before
using them. Very often also too little coffee is used.</p>

<p>Tinned coffee is often adulterated with either Chicory or
Endives, but those are only the two most important impurities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
for burnt sugar, biscuits, locust-beans, date-stones,
rye, malt, and other substances are ground up and mixed
with coffee.</p>

<p>The use of chicory is, however, more or less recognized.
It is the roots which are ground up and mixed with it.
They contain no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caffeine</i>, which is the active part of the
coffee bean, and are quite harmless. At one time chicory
was grown in Essex and other English counties, and was a
distinctly profitable crop.</p>

<p>Here again come in the mysterious ways of the British
Government. The cultivation of chicory was absolutely
forbidden by the Inland Revenue Department; but a
considerable amount is still grown in Belgium and is imported
to this country. Those who prefer chicory with their
coffee have to pay a heavy duty; but the Belgian farmer is
allowed and the British farmer is forbidden to take up a
paying and profitable industry! The plant is allied to the
dandelion. It occasionally occurs in this country as a weed,
and is a rather striking plant with bright blue flowers.</p>

<p>Another of these useful productions which also suffers from
a heavy duty is Cocoa or Chocolate. There are a great many
different plants called Co Co, or by some name very similar to
it. The Cocoanut Palm furnishes not only the nuts but the
fibre or coir enclosing them, as well as a great many other
useful substances. The <em>cocaine</em> used by dentists, and
which deadens or stupefies the nerves of the teeth, is derived
from the leaves of a Peruvian shrub, "Coca" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erythroxylan
Coca</i>). These leaves are chewed in the mouth
and have very extraordinary effects, especially on the Indian
labourers. They are a strong nerve stimulus and take away
any feeling of hunger or fatigue. It was by the use of coca
leaves that the postmen of the Inca emperors in Peru were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
enabled to carry messages at the rate of 150 miles a day.
Then again the Cocoes of the West Indian Islands is a sort
of Yam (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colocasia antiquorum</i>). Coco-de-mer is the fruit of
a palm common in the Seychelles Islands (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lodoicea Seychellarum</i>).</p>

<p>The cocoa which gives the ordinary chocolate and cocoa of
the breakfast table is the seed of a tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theobroma cacao</i>).
The name is derived from &#952;&#949;&#959;&#962;, god, and &#946;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;, food. It
may be translated, "That which the gods browse upon."</p>

<p>This plant is one of those which were cultivated by that
ancient, powerful, semi-civilized nation, the Aztecs of Mexico.
They have almost entirely vanished; at any rate their
descendants, if they have any, exercise practically no influence
in the world, but they have left us chocolate. They
fully appreciated the plant, and even more than we do, for
they worshipped it with grateful and superstitious awe.</p>

<p>In their tombs, chocolate flavoured with vanilla was
placed, in order to provide the ghost with sufficient sustenance
for his or her aerial flight to the Land of the Sun.
Columbus brought home some cocoa on his return from his
first voyage. The Jesuit fathers in Mexico greatly helped
in developing the plantation of cocoa in the days of the
Spaniards. At present the largest amount comes from
Ecuador, which produces about 50,000,000 pounds weight.</p>

<p>It is a small tree, twenty to thirty feet high, growing in
the warm, moist, and sheltered forests of Central and South
America. It has a large fruit, within which are the numerous
cocoa beans, "nibs," or seeds. The tree does not bear until
it is five years old. The fermentation and drying of the
beans require some care.</p>

<p>Chocolate is made from the powdered cocoa mixed with
sugar and other materials. Chocolate, like tea and coffee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
depends for its effect on an extremely powerful drug, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">theine</i>
or <em>caffeine</em>, of which it contains minute proportions. There
are very few other plants known which possess this powerful
substance. Amongst these is the Kola nut, which is everywhere
regularly employed in West Africa. On the way up
to the barracks at Freetown, Sierra Leone, natives were
always to be seen seated by the roadside; they sold kola
nuts to the soldiers, who were thereby enabled to walk
steadily and uprightly past the sentry, and to return his
challenge in a clearly articulate voice, although they might
previously have been somewhat injudiciously convivial in the
town. This kola is one of the very strongest nerve tonics;
under its influence men can endure severe physical and
mental strain. Like the others, however, a depressing reaction
inevitably follows, accompanied by insomnia, headache,
and other evil effects.</p>

<p>When one comes to ask, Why do those few plants out
of all the vast multitude of the vegetable world possess such
extraordinary virtues? it is difficult to find an answer.
Possibly some obscure insect or fungus enemy finds <em>caffeine</em>
poisonous.</p>

<p>Nor can one find any reason for the curious properties
developed in the Tobacco leaf by fermentation, except
a possible protection to the leaf from the attacks of insects.
No doubt the leaf, even in its natural state, would be too
strong for them.</p>

<p>Tobacco is a native of Central America. The name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nicotiana tabacum</i> is derived (the first) from a certain Jean
Nicot, Ambassador to the King of Portugal, and the second
from the Haytian name for a pipe.</p>

<p>On Columbus's voyage in 1492 the use of tobacco was
noted. The story of Sir Walter Raleigh's servant, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
threw a bucket of water over his master when the latter was
smoking a pipe, is not supported by much evidence, but it
seems to be probable that Sir Walter did smoke his pipe on
the way to the scaffold.</p>

<p>At any rate it was cultivated in Europe by the year 1570,
and Spenser speaks of the "soveraine Weed, divine Tobacco."</p>

<p>From the first it was detested by all governments and
authorities. James I published a very intemperate <em>Counterblast
against Tobacco</em>. It was prohibited by the Czar of
Russia in 1635, and by the King of France. The great
Sultan Jehanghir in India, Sultan Amurath II in Turkey,
Shah Abbas the Great in Persia, and the Emperor Kang
Ching in China, all prohibited the use of tobacco in their
respective dominions.</p>

<p>Yet none of these great rulers were able to check its
progress. The "Herb of Amiability," or the "Queen Herb
of the rude Barbarian" as it is described in Chinese, prevails
almost over the whole earth. There is scarcely a people or
tribe in existence which does not use it.</p>

<p>But almost everywhere it is either heavily taxed or a
Government monopoly; in the latter case it is always
exceedingly bad. We ourselves import tobacco worth about
£4,500,000 in the year, and pay a heavy duty. The
world probably smokes from 1,800,000,000 to 2,000,000,000
pounds of tobacco every year.</p>

<p>The plant is a very pretty one, with large leaves and long
pinky or white flowers, which are open and strongly scented
at night. It is an annual, and is not at all difficult to cultivate.
There is an impression in this country that it is a
tropical plant, but by far the greatest amount of our
tobacco comes from temperate countries. Large quantities
are grown in Germany, in Hungary, and in other parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Europe. As a matter of fact tobacco was once cultivated in
both England and Scotland.</p>

<p>There is evidence to show that in 1832 it was successfully
grown in Roxburghshire, where 1000 pounds an acre was
obtained. The land was let at about £5 to £6 per acre.
Experiments of recent years have also proved very encouraging,
and in fact it is difficult to see how any reasonable doubt
can exist as to the fact that it would be perfectly easy to
grow plenty of that sort of tobacco which we now obtain
from Holland and Germany. A prominent Irish statesman
has admitted this: "There was no doubt but that tobacco
could be grown in Ireland, but whether there are Irishmen
patriotic enough to smoke it, <em>is</em> very doubtful."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Of course every one knows that the differences in tobacco
depend chiefly on the preparation, but the <em>Constitutional</em>
objection to tobacco, illustrated by the above remark, is the
real reason why it is not grown.</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell sent his troopers to ride down the growing
crops. Charles II imposed a penalty of £1600 per acre.
Modern statesmen are flippant and unfair.</p>

<p>The reason of course is that a large income is cheaply
obtained by taxing imported tobacco. If this were at all
interfered with, new taxes, which would certainly be unpopular,
would be required.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of interest in the story of the
tobacco plantations. Many prisoners of the Civil War in
England were sold to Virginia and other places. Even
nowadays there is some romance in the history of a cigar.
In the Dutch island of Sumatra the jungle is cleared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
away by the natives under the orders of an English
manager. Chinese coolies are then imported. The estate
provides each coolie with tools, tea, a barber, and sufficient
cash to buy rice, fish, or pork, as well as a little over for his
opium, to spend in fireworks, and to propitiate his demons.</p>

<p>The coolie grows the tobacco, which is bought from him
and manufactured by the estate. Some of it goes to India,
where it is used as the outer wrapper of cigars.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>For adulterating tobacco all sorts of leaves are occasionally
employed, such as those of the dock, chicory, burdock,
foxglove, comfrey, elm, coltsfoot, plantain, beech, cabbage,
lettuce (steeped in tar oil), etc., etc.</p>

<p>The substance nicotine is a deadly and dangerous poison.
When young people smoke tobacco, it has been quite conclusively
proved that they will very probably not reach their
full growth, but be miserable weaklings, stunted, half-developed,
and below the proper standard of a man.</p>

<p>This is not surprising, if one reflects on the constitution of
tobacco smoke. This contains "nicotine, empyreumatic
resin, oil, ammonia, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, hydrocyanic
acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen,
and paraffin."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">ON DESERTS</span></h2>

<p class="hanging">What are deserts like?&mdash;Camel-riding&mdash;Afterglow&mdash;Darwin in South
America&mdash;Big Bad Lands&mdash;Plants which train themselves to endure

in Egypt&mdash;The creaking Sakkieh&mdash;Alexandria hills&mdash;The
Nile and Euphrates.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>CROSS the whole of Africa, at its very broadest part,
from the dominions of the Emperor of the Sahara at
Cape Juby on the Atlantic, and to the very borders
of British India, stretches a desert of the most uncompromising
character. It is famous in history: the strongest
races of man, the great religions of the world, as well as
most cultivated plants and domestic animals, have originated
in some part of this dreary waste.</p>

<p>One cannot really appreciate deserts unless one has really
seen them. But it is necessary to try to describe what they
are like.</p>

<p>Sometimes the desert is a wilderness of broken, stony
hills covered by angular pieces of shivered rock. In other
places the soil is hard, and is everywhere covered by pebbles
or shingle. Often it is a mere waste of sand blown into
downs and hillocks which look sometimes like the sand dunes
by the coast, and elsewhere like the waves of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
One finds valleys in the desert quite like ordinary ones in
shape, but instead of water there is only sand in sweeping
curves and hollows, like the snow-wreaths and drifts in a
highland glen.</p>

<p>Rocks stand out of this, but their projecting faces are
polished smooth and glittering or deeply cut by the flinty
particles scraping over them continually in storms and
hurricanes.</p>

<p>The traveller on camel-back, where his waist has to act as
a sort of universal joint giving to every unexpected jolt and
wrench of his rough-paced mount, suffers from the heat, for
nowhere else in the world are there such high temperatures.
He suffers from thirst, and still more from the dust which
fills eyes, mouth, nostrils, and ears.</p>

<p>Yet the dry pure air is most exhilarating.</p>

<p>In the evening there is a feast for the eyes in the glorious
<em>afterglow</em> when the sun has just set. The light from below
the horizon produces an ever-changing, indescribable play of
colour from violet to salmon pink and through the most
delicate shades of yellow, blue, and rose, until everything
fades and there reigns only the mysterious silence of the
beautiful starlit night.</p>

<p>No wonder the air is dry and pure, for rain only falls on
perhaps eight days in the year in some places (Ghardiaia).</p>

<p>Yet plants manage to exist even where there is only about
seven inches of rain annually.</p>

<p>But this seems still more extraordinary if one remembers
that sand may be almost glowing hot during the day, whilst
in winter it may be, at night, cooled below the freezing-point.</p>

<p>Yet a desert absolutely bare of plants is an exceedingly
rare phenomenon. Such do occur. Darwin speaks of "an undulating
country, a complete and utter desert." This is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
very far from Iquique in South America. "The road was
strewed with the bones and dried skins of the many beasts of
burden which had perished upon it from fatigue. Excepting
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vultur aura</i>, which preys on the carcases, I saw neither
bird, quadruped, reptile, nor insect. On the coast mountains,
at the height of about 2000 feet, where, during this
season, the clouds generally hang, a very few cacti were growing
in the clefts of rock; and the loose sand was strewed
over with a lichen which lies on the surface quite unattached.
... In some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the
sand, as seen from a distance, of a pale yellowish colour.
Farther inland, during the whole ride of fourteen leagues, I
saw only one other vegetable production, and that was a
most minute yellow lichen, growing on the bones of the
dead mules."<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Rydberg, speaking of the Big Bad Lands in South Dakota,
says that there are in some places great stretches of land consisting
of cañons separated by small ridges, in which not a
speck of green is visible over several sections.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> (A section is
more than a square mile.)</p>

<p>But though Aden looks exactly like "a barrack stove that
no one's lit for years and years," plants grow there. Even in
Egypt, when one has left the Nile inundation limit, a
botanical eye very seldom fails to detect plants of one sort or
another even in a dangerous and thorough-going desert.</p>

<p>Plants are almost as hardy as men; they can adapt themselves
to almost any climate.</p>

<p>In some curious and inexplicable way the very dangers of
the climate seem to produce automatically a means of resisting
it. The chief peril, of course, is a loss of the precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
water through the leaves. When the skin or epidermis of a
plant is being formed, the walls of its cells are laid down,
layer by layer, one inside the other, by the secretion of the
living matter inside. In a dry desert the loss of water by
evaporation will be so rapid that these layers of cell-wall are
much thicker than in ordinary plants. The very fact that
they are thicker and less penetrable tends to prevent any
further loss of water.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>So that plants in a dry climate have the power of altering
themselves to resist its dangers.</p>

<p>Another author found that, in Scandinavia, plants of the
same species can acclimatize themselves if necessary. Sheep's
Sorrel which had grown on dry, droughty gravel banks only
lost 10 per cent. of its water in the first two days, when it
was artificially dried. Other Sheep's Sorrels, which had been
luxuriating in meadows where they had no lack of moisture,
lost no less than one third (33 per cent.) of their water when
dried in the same way.</p>

<p>That is interesting, because very likely our readers might
in crossing a desert be perishing of thirst when a Bedouin
Arab would be perfectly happy. The plants have learnt to
do without water just in the same way as the Arab has done.</p>

<p>Of the many interesting desert plants, the Succulents,
Cacti, Euphorbias, and others of the same extraordinary,
fleshy, dropsical appearance, come first.</p>

<p>When a Cereus plant (one of the American Giant Cacti)
was dried, it did not lose the whole of its water for 576 days.
That is probably the longest time "between drinks" on
record. A Houseleek (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sempervivum</i>), which has to grow on
dry rocks where it has no water for days together, remained
quite fresh for 165 days.</p>

<div><a name="giant_cactus_near_aconcagua_valley_chile" id="giant_cactus_near_aconcagua_valley_chile"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="smcap">Giant Cactus near Aconcagua Valley, Chile</p>
<p>This plant was about 8 feet high. The darker part on the tallest branch is the
dark red flower of the parasitic horanthus. The thorns covering the branches are
quite distinct.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
There are several reasons why these plants took so long to
dry up. To begin with, they have inside their stems and
leaves certain substances which hold water and delay its
escape. Moreover their extraordinary shapes are of very
great assistance. They prefer globular, round, circular,
pear-shaped, or cylindrical forms.</p>

<p>Suppose you were to cut such a round mass into thin slices
and lay them out flat, it is quite clear that they would cover
a much greater surface. Thin leaves also, if squashed up
into a round ball, would have a very much smaller surface.</p>

<p>The water can only escape from the surface exposed, so
that these condensed round balls and fleshy columns have
far less water-losing surface than ordinary leaves.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was found by calculation that the
surface of an Echinocactus was 300 times less for the same
amount of stuff as that of an Aristolochia leaf. If the
actual loss of water from the Echinocactus, as found by experiment,
was reckoned as one unit per square inch, then the
amount of water lost from a square inch of the Aristolochia
was no less than 5000 units!</p>

<p>This shows that these odd, outrageous shapes of Prickly
Pears, Cacti, and other succulents are an extraordinary help
to them. We have already pointed out in a previous chapter
how necessary their spines and prickles are if they must
resist rats, mice, camels, and other enemies.</p>

<p>What we may call the "hedgehog" type of plant is also
very common in desert countries. There are many woody
little, much branched, twiggy shrublets, which bristle all over
with thorns and spines. They are not at all fleshy, but do
with the least conceivable amount of water.</p>

<p>Another striking characteristic of the desert flora is
noticed by every one. Almost every plant is clothed either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in white cottonwool, like the Lammie's Lug of our gardens,
or else in grey hairs. The general tint of the landscape is
not green, but it is rather the colour of the soil silvered over
by these grey-haired plants.</p>

<p>The reason of this is, of course, quite easy to understand.
We put on a thick overcoat if we are going to walk in a
Scotch mist, to keep out the moisture. These plants cover
themselves with hairs or cottonwool to keep the moisture
inside. It does not escape easily through the woolly hairs on
the skin.</p>

<p>One very strange plant should be noticed here. This is
the Iceplant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mesembryanthemum cristallinum</i>). Every part
of it is covered with little glittering swellings which shine in
the sun like minute ice crystals. The swellings contain a
store of water, or rather of colourless sap, which makes it able
to exist in dry places. Dr. Ludwig says that a torn-off branch
remained quite fresh for months on his study table. It is
probable that these peculiar pearl or ice-like swellings also
focus the sunlight, acting like lenses, upon the inner part of
the leaf, but that is not as yet fully understood.</p>

<p>There are two grasses, growing in the desert, which are of
some value; both are called Esparto or Halfa. They are very
dry, woody, or rather wiry grasses, especially common in
Algeria, Tripoli, and also found in Spain. One of them,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stipa tenacissima</i>, grows in rocky soil in Morocco, Algeria,
and Tripoli. The Arabs search for it in the hills, and dig it
up by the roots; they then load their camels with the grass
and bring it to the ports whence it is sent to London or
other places. A very good and durable paper is made from
it, and ropes, mats, and even shoes are also produced from the
fibre. Part of the "esparto" is, however, furnished by
another grass (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lygeum sparteum</i>). The natives sometimes tie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
a knot in a halfa leaf, which, according to them, cures a
strain of the back. The Stipa is also used as fodder, but it
is not nutritious and is indeed sometimes dangerous. In one
year Britain imported 187,000 tons of esparto, worth nearly
£800,000. The yield is said to be about ten tons per acre.</p>

<p>Another very interesting plant at Tripoli and in the North
African Desert generally, is a sort of broom, the Retama
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Retama Raetam</i>). It is not very unlike the common broom,
but has long, leafless, whip-like branches covered by bright
pink-and-white flowers. It can often be seen half submerged
in waves of sand, and struggling nevertheless to hold its
own. As it has no leaves its loss of water is very much kept
down. This is the Juniper of the Bible, and it is still used
for making coals.</p>

<p>The length of the roots is very great in most of the
broom-like, "hedgehog," and other plants. A quite small
plant not more than six or eight inches high will have a root
as thick as one's thumb. Even at a depth of four or five
feet below the surface its root will be as thick as the little
finger, so that the root-length is at least twenty times the
height of the visible part above ground. These thirsty
roots explore the ground in every direction, and go very deep
downwards in their search for water.</p>

<p>Another very interesting plant in the Egyptian Desert is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Citrullus Colocynth</i>, from which the drug colocynth is prepared.
The great round yellow-green fruit and finely divided
bright green leaves may be seen lying on the sand. It
remains green all the summer, but appears not to have any
particular protection against loss of water. It is always
supplied by its roots with underground water. If a stem is
cut through it withers away in a few minutes. This is
found also in Asia Minor, Greece, and Spain. The pulp of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the fruit contains a strong medicinal substance; it is a
drastic purgative, and in overdoses is an irritant poison.
This was probably the Wild Vine or gourd which the young
prophet gathered, and which produced "death in the pot."
He probably mistook it for a water melon. It is still
plentiful near Gilgal (2 Kings xiv. 38-41).<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Below the surface of the earth, of course, there is not
nearly the same dryness or danger of losing water, so that
there are often a great number of bulbs, tubers, and the like
hidden in the soil. There they wait patiently, sometimes
for a whole year or even for a longer period. So soon as
a shower of rain falls they start to life, push out their
leaves, and live at very high pressure for a few days. After a
shower of rain, the Karoo in South Africa, for instance,
is an extraordinarily beautiful country. There are bulbous
Pelargoniums, a very curious leafless cucurbitaceous plant
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthosicyos</i>), hundreds and thousands of Lilies, Irids,
and Amaryllids. A single scarlet flower of a Brunsvigia
can be seen more than a mile away!</p>

<p>These tender and delicate, exquisitely beautiful bulbs
flourish amongst the succulent Euphorbias and Mesembryanthemums,
between the hedgehog-like thorny plants and the
woody little densely-branched mats of the permanent flora.
The rain stimulates even these last to put out green leaves
and flowers, but their time comes later on, when by the
return of the usual drought every leaf and flower and the
fruit of every bulb has been shrivelled up, turned into
powder, and scattered in dust by the wind.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Then the Karoo becomes unlovely, desolate, and barren-looking,
with only its inconspicuous permanent plants visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
The above description applies to bulbs and perennial
plants with underground stores of food. Yet these are by
no means the only plants which manage to exist in the
Egyptian and Arabian desert. After a shower of rain a
whole crowd of tiny annuals suddenly develop from seed;
they come into full flower and have set their seed before they
are killed off by a return of the desert conditions, when the
effects of the rain have died away. These plants are not
really desert plants at all, for they only grow during the
short time that it is not a desert. They are like the
Ephemerid insects which live for a summer day only.</p>

<p>Nor is it only in Egypt that we find such ephemerals.
Mr. Coville found them in the Colorado desert in North
America. The plants are quite different, but similar conditions
have brought about an entirely similar mode of life
on the other side of the globe! In Colorado they seem to
be much influenced by the quantity of rain. Mr. Orcutt,
after the great rain of February, 1891, found plants of
Amaranthus (allied to our Love-Lies-Bleeding), which were
ten feet in height, but in 1892 he found specimens of the
same in the same place only nine inches high, though they
were perfect plants and in full flower; in this last year there
was only the usual very scanty rainfall.</p>

<p>It is, however, in deserts when man has set to work and
supplies water and strenuous labour, that the most wonderful
results appear. The whole of lower Egypt, Babylon,
Nineveh, Damascus, Baghdad, Palmyra, and other historic
cities, show what the desert can be made to produce.</p>

<p>As one slowly steams up the Nile from Philae or Shellal
towards Wady Halfa, there are places where the brown,
regular layers of the Nubian Sandstone form cliffs which
advance almost to the water's edge. Yet there is a narrow
strip of green which fringes the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
It is upon the actual bank itself, which is a gentle slope
of ten to fifteen feet, that Lupines, Lubia beans, and other
plants are regularly cultivated. This narrow green ribbon
remains almost always on each bank. Where the cliffs
recede, one notices a line of tall, graceful date palms, mixed
occasionally with the branched Dôm palm (the nut of which
yields vegetable ivory).<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Tamarisks, conspicuous for their
confused, silvery-green foliage, can be noticed here and there.
The Acacias are common enough, and sometimes one of
them is used as a hedge. It is a spreading, intricately-branched
little shrub, with very white branches and stout
curved thorns.</p>

<p>If one lands and strolls along the banks below the palm
trees or amongst plantations of barley, wheat, or lentils, one
sees the native women in their dark green robes gathering
fruits or digging. Goats and donkeys are tethered here and
there. There are sure to be castor-oil bushes. Small but
neat pigeons, with a chestnut-coloured breast and bluish-banded
tails are perching on the palms or acacias, and utter
their weak little coo. The air is suffering from the horrible
creaking and groaning of a "sakkieh" water-wheel. This
is made entirely of acacia wood, and is watering the plantations.
Sometimes it seems like a crying child, then, perhaps,
one is reminded of the bagpipes, but its most marked peculiarity
is the wearisome iteration. It never stops. One of them
is said to supply about 1-1/2 acres daily at a cost of seven
shillings per diem. Exactly the same instrument can be seen
pictured on the monuments of Egypt 4000 to 5000 years
ago. The "shadouf" is of still older date. This is a long
pole bearing at one end a pot or paraffin tin and balanced
by a mass of dried mud or a stone. All day long a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
can be seen scooping up the coffee-coloured water of the
Nile and pouring it on the land for the magnificent sum of
one piastre a day.</p>

<p>Where not irrigated, the soil is dry and parched and can
only carry a few miserable little thorny bushes. The entire
absence of grass on the brick-like soil has a very strange
effect to English eyes.</p>

<p>The Date Palm, however, requires a little respectful consideration.
If one enters a thick grove and looks upwards,
the idea of Egyptian architecture as distinguished from
Gothic and others is at once visible. It has quite the same
effect as the great hall of columns near Luxor. The
numerous stems ending in the crown at the top where the
leaves spring off was quite clearly in the minds of the
architect at Karnak and other temples. It goes on bearing
its fruits for some two hundred years, and begins to yield
when only seven years old. It revels in a hot, dry climate
with its roots in water, and seems to require scarcely any
care in cultivation. Yet during the first few years of its life
it is necessary to water the seedling. A single tree may
give eight to ten bunches of dates worth about six shillings.
Generally it is reproduced by the suckers which spring out
from the base of the tree.</p>

<p>Dates make a very excellent food, not merely pleasant
but both wholesome and nutritious. Sometimes toddy is
made by fermenting the sap, but this is a very wasteful
process, as it is apt to kill the tree.</p>

<p>The stones are often ground up to make food for camels.
The feathery leaves are exceedingly graceful. When quite
young they are not divided, but they split down to the main
stalk along the folds, so that a full-grown leaf affords but
little hold to the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
In some parts of Egypt, as for instance at Mariout, which
is some fifteen miles from Alexandria, the wild flowers are
probably more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
Amongst the corn and barley, which can be there grown
without irrigation, masses of scarlet Poppies and Ranunculus
are mingled with golden-yellow Composites, bright purple
Asphodels, and hundreds of other Eastern flowers. The
result is a rich feast of colour indescribable and satisfying to
the soul.</p>

<p>So that these deserts under the hand of man rejoice and
blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>Why is it that, as Disraeli has pointed out, civilization,
culture, science, and religion had their origins in the desert?
The answer is not difficult to see: for there is a dry, healthy
climate; the severe strain of a long day's journey is varied
by enforced leisure, when, resting at his tent-door, the Arab
is irresistibly compelled to study the stars and to contemplate
the infinite beauty of the night. It seems also to have been
in the desert of the old world that man first learnt to cultivate
the soil. In fact, it was only by irrigation on great
tracts of alluvium, such as were furnished by the Nile and
Euphrates, that the enormous populations of Egypt, Babylon,
Nineveh, and the other great monarchies could be
maintained. So that city life on a big scale first developed
there.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HEN the eyes of man first beheld Britain, what
sort of country was this of ours? It is very
interesting to try to imagine what it was like, but
of course it is a very difficult task. Still it is worth the
attempt, for we ought to know something of what has been
done by our forefathers.</p>

<p>Where the great rivers Thames, Humber, Tyne, Forth,
Clyde, Mersey, and Severn, approached the seashore they
lost themselves in wildernesses of desolate, dreary fenlands.
Here a small scrubby wood of willow, birch, and alder;
there a miles-wide stretch of reeds and undrained marsh
intersected by sluggish, lazy rivers, or varied by stagnant
pools. The bittern boomed in those marshes. Herons,
geese, swans, ducks, and aquatic birds of all sorts found what
is now Chelsea a paradise, only disturbed by the eagle,
harrier-hawk, vulture, and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Neither at the mouth nor even much higher up in its valley-course,
was a river a steady stream in a defined bed. Such
beds as it had were probably four or five times their present
width; they would be quite irregular, meandering about,
changing at every flood, full of islands, loops, backwaters, and
continually interrupted by snags of trees.</p>

<p>The rolling hills of the lowlands would be an almost
unbroken forest of oak, except where perhaps level land and
the absence of drainage produced a marsh or horrible peat-moss.
But when we say forest, we do not mean a glorified
Richmond Park.</p>

<p>In good soil there might indeed be tall and magnificent
trees. But it would be quite impossible to see them! The
giants of the forest would be concealed in an inextricable
tangle of young trees, brushwood, fallen logs, creepers, and
undergrowth. Where the soil was sandy or stony, it might
be a scrub rather than a forest, of gnarled, twisted, and
stunted oaks, or possibly thickets of sloe, birch, rowan,
hawthorn, brambles, and briers.</p>

<p>Every stream would be "wild water" leaping down waterfalls
and cutting out irregular, little woody ravines. Here
and there boulders and escarpments of rock would break
through the forest soil, which would be mossy, thick with
undergrowth, and entangled with rotting fallen trunks and
branches, crossing at every conceivable angle. The higher
hills were covered by a dreary, sombre pine forest. It was
of a monotonous, desolate character. Greenish-grey tufts of
Old Man's Beard lichen hung from the branches. The
ground, treacherous, and broken by boulders, peaty hollows,
and dead logs, would be shrouded in a soft, thick cushion of
feathery Mosses, with Blaeberry, Ferns, Trientalis, Linnea,
Dwarf Cornel, and other rare plants. Through it descended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
raging and destructive torrents which here might be checked
and foamed over dead logs, whilst in another place they
cut out bare earth-escarpments or started new waterfalls
which ate back into the hills behind.</p>

<p>At the summit of the higher hills, bare rock crags projected
out of occasional alpine grassy slopes, or irregular
terraces, ravines, and gullies. Below, these alpine ravines
ended in a peat-moss, which scattered, dwarfed, distorted,
and miserable-looking Scotch Firs and Birches painfully
endeavoured to colonize. Here and there on very steep
hillsides, wiry, tussocky grass might be growing instead of
forest or peat.</p>

<p>A horrible, forbidding, and desolate land, where Deer,
Irish elk, bison, bear, wolf, boar, wolverine, badger, and
fox, alone enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>Now consider our country to-day. Mark the "trim little
fields"; "that hedge there must have been clipt about
eighty years"; "The lifting day showed the stucco villas on
the green and the awful orderliness of England&mdash;line upon
line, wall upon wall, solid stone dock and monolithic pier."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
The road, carefully macadamized, sweeps on correct and
straight or gracefully curving from neat village to countrytown.
In the heart of the country the roadsides are scraped
bare to produce that hideous tidiness which is dear to the
soul of the County Council roadman. That is if an individual
whose life is spent in stubbing up roses, briers, and
every visible wild flower, can possibly possess a soul! Those
fields without a rock, or even a projecting stone, have been
drained, dug over, and levelled with the greatest possible
care. The very rivers have been straightened and embanked;
the rows of pollarded willows have been planted;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
they may, when in flood, overflow, but the results are very
soon no longer visible. Even on the moors and in the
depths of the Highlands, black-faced sheep, draining, and
the regular burning of the heather, have quite transformed
our country.</p>

<p>The original woods have long since vanished: those which
now exist are mostly quite artificial plantations, and the
very trees are often strangers to Britain.</p>

<p>The story of the Herculean labour by which our country,
once as wild and as savage as its early inhabitants the
Icenians and Catieuchlanians (and probably with lineaments
as barbarous as those of the Coritanian and Trinobant),
has been changed to peaceful, fertile meadowlands or
tidy arable, is one long romance. To tell it properly would
require a book to itself. In this chapter we shall only try
to sketch what may have happened on one particular cornfield
which exists on the trap-rocks of Kilbarchan, near
Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The reader must bear in mind that even this is
a very ambitious attempt! It is an exceedingly difficult
undertaking.</p>

<p>The subsoil in this particular cornfield (on Pennell Brae)
lies upon the trap-rock formed by one of those gigantic
lava-flows which cover that part of Renfrewshire. The
whole district at that time must have been exactly like
Vesuvius during the late eruption. Its scenery in this early
miocene period consisted of glowing molten rock, accompanied
by flames of fire, electrical storms, clouds of gas, dust,
ashes, and superheated steam.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_147.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="smcap">and Now</p>
<p>The same landscape at the present time. Notice how the outline of the hills has been softened and its shape rounded. The
forest has almost vanished and the river is bridged and confined within definite banks; in fact, only the ravine remains much the
same.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Every plant and every animal must have been exterminated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
That was unfortunate, for, at that time, Pines, Oaks,
Guelder Rose, Willows, as well as Sequoias allied to the
Mammoth tree and Sassafras, may have lived in Scotland
along with tapirs, opossums, marsupials, and other extraordinary
beasts.</p>

<p>When the lava cooled and became trap-rock, it was at once
attacked by frost, by wind, and by rain. Then by a very
slow process of colonization, vegetation slowly and gradually
crept over the trap-rock and rich mould and plant remains
accumulated. At a much later date, there was another
wholesale destruction. This time, it was the great Ice Sheet
coming down from the Highland hills. Probably it drove
heavily over the top of Pennell Brae and worked up into fine
mud and powder every vestige of the miocene vegetation.</p>

<p>The very rocks themselves would be scratched, polished,
and rounded off. When the glaciers melted away and left
the surface free, it would consist of these rounded rocks alternating
with clay-filled hollows. The trap-rock below would
be covered by a subsoil due to particles of trap, of Highland
and other mud, with remains of the miocene vegetation.
Upon this surface, frost, wind, sunshine, and rain would
again begin to perform their work.</p>

<p>But the subsoil, thus wonderfully formed by fire in the
miocene, by frost in the glacial, and by weather in our own
geological period, very soon felt the protecting and sheltering
effect of a plant-covering.</p>

<p>First a green herb rooted itself every here and there amidst
the desolate boulder-clay or perhaps in a crevice where good
earth had accumulated. Then the scattered colonists began
to form groups; soon patches of green moss united them.
Then a continuous green carpet could be traced over a few
yards here and perhaps on a few feet somewhere else. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
when things had got as far as this, progress became much
more rapid, and soon the whole site of the future cornfield
was covered over by a continuous green carpet. Only, every
here and there, hard stones and uncompromising trap-rocks
remained still protruding from the green covering.</p>

<p>In another chapter this first covering of the soil will be
described at length.</p>

<p>So far it has been <em>subsoil</em> and <em>underlying rock</em>, but now the
roots begin to disintegrate and work up the subsoil; the earthworm
has his chance, and forms true <em>soil</em>. On this particular
hillside, the water would drain away and there would be no
danger of mosses strangling and choking the Blaeberry and
the Heather. The worm flourished and multiplied, and the
soil became rich and black. Here and there a Sloe or a
Rowan, or Poplar, or perhaps Alder and Birch, began to
appear. In certain places Whins and Brooms, Brambles
and Briers, diversified the hillside. Then a few Scotch firs
began to push their way up, through the thickets. At first
they were very small and stunted, but as each one formed a
dense, deep-going mass of hardy roots, they were able to
investigate the riches of the subsoil. Every year the
amount of leaf-mould above increased, until the original
moss-covering was utterly destroyed and a pine forest (see
Chap. <span class="smcap">XXVIII.</span>) occupied Pennell Brae.</p>

<p>About this time, a paleolithic family may have encamped
on the side of the cliff near a little stream which can still be
traced. The camp was only a few sticks and branches, with
a skin or two for shelter from the north wind. The women
lopped down fir branches for firewood, and cut up the young
trees. The children set fire to the shrubs on dry days and
paths ran here and there through the forest. This would be
about 198,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Every year meant a further very gradual, slow destruction
of the pine forest.</p>

<p>About 60,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, our paleolithic hunters with chipped-stone
weapons would be obliged to travel further to the
north. New savages with round heads and polished-stone
weapons would make life in Renfrewshire too uncertain and
too diversified by massacres. These last possessed seed corn,
a few fruit trees as well as goats, cattle, and perhaps a few
hardy, shaggy ponies. At first these settlers would be
obliged to live in a lake dwelling, say in Linwood Moss,
which is close at hand. They would then drive their cattle
over the surrounding district, and camp in slightly-built
villages. Near at hand, probably on the hill, they would
build a (round) camp or fort, where they could fly for safety
in the continual fights and invasions of the period.</p>

<p>Sooner or later a village would be built near Pennell Brae.
One summer day the villagers attacked the wood that
covered it; they cut down all the small brushwood and
hacked through the bark of every big tree. After a few
weeks, when the trees were dead, the wood was set on fire.
Then a rough fold made of rude wattle and daub was
formed, and every night the cattle and sheep were driven in.</p>

<p>After three or four years, this fold would be ploughed up
by exceedingly rude instruments. Barley or certain kinds of
wheat would be grown year after year until the crop was not
worth gathering. When that happened, another fold would
be ploughed up. Probably the whole of Pennell Brae went
through this rude sort of agricultural treatment at one time
or another. At the same time goats, cattle, and the demand
for firewood, obtained in the most reckless and wasteful
manner, would have very seriously interfered with the
forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Although no doubt great changes for the better were introduced,
the spearmen of Wallace of Elderslie close by had their
"infield" land, which was practically the sheepfold as above
described, and their "outfield" or grazing commons. Even
down to 1745 the above system was practised (see below).</p>

<p>But when men's minds were stirred up and invigorated by
the great Revolution of 1788-1820, all sorts of new agricultural
discoveries were made. Yet the cornfield on Pennell
Brae was probably not drained or enclosed by stone walls
and hedges until 1830 to 1840! About 1870, it was more
profitable to its owner than it has ever been since, though
even now it forms part of our British farmlands which
yield, on the whole, a larger amount of oats per acre than
those of any other country in the world (except possibly
Denmark).</p>

<p>Let us however look a little closer into the long, long
period during which the "fire and stone-axe methods" of
farming prevailed. Before the Romans landed there seem
to have been no towns.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> There was but little cultivation, for
the Britons wore skins and lived chiefly on milk and
flesh.</p>

<p>In the time of King Alfred, the increase of population
made it necessary to take more trouble about farming, so we
find a description of what the good farmer ought to do. We
might call this the very first Government leaflet, and it has
led to the Agricultural Leaflets published by the Board of
Agriculture for Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>"Sethe wille wyrcan wastbaere lond ateo hin of tham
acre aefest sona fearn and thornas and figrsas swasame
weods."</p>

<p>He was to clear off fern, bracken, thorns, sloe, hawthorn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
bramble, whin, and weeds. The names of the months give
some idea of Anglo-Saxon methods of farming. May was
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thrimylce</i>, because the cows might then be milked thrice a
day. August was <em>Weodmonath</em> (weed-month), November
<em>Blotmonath</em>, or blood-month, because the cattle were then
killed to supply salt beef for winter time.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Very much later in history, after our English friends had
laid waste and depopulated Scotland, so that woods sprang
up again everywhere, and again long after that time when
the gradual increase of population had again utterly destroyed
those woods, a certain Dr. Johnson travelled from
Carlisle to Edinburgh. This gentleman declared that he
saw no tree between those places. This statement must not
be taken too literally, for he had written a dictionary and
considered himself not merely the <em>Times</em> but an <em>Encyclopædia
Britannica</em> as well.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of Dundonald (in 1795) thus describes the
agriculture of 1745 (Prince Charlie's days): "The outfield
land never receives any manure. After taking from it two
or three crops of grain it is left in the state it was in at
reaping the last crop, without sowing thereon grass-seeds for
the protection of any sort of herbage. During the first two
or three years a sufficiency of grass to maintain a couple of
rabbits per acre is scarcely produced. In the course of some
years it acquires a sward, and after having been depastured
for some years more, it is again submitted to the same
barbarous system of husbandry" (that is used as a fold and
then ploughed up). In the same year (1745) in Meigle
parish, the land was never allowed to lie fallow: neither
pease, grass, turnips, nor potatoes were raised. No cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
were fattened. A little grain (oats or barley) was exported.
In 1754 or thereabouts, there was only one cart in the
parish of Keithhall. Everything was carried about on
ponies' backs, as is the case nowadays in the most unsettled
parts of Canada. The country in places was almost impassable.
Bridges did not exist, and the roads were mere
tracks. In Rannoch the tenants had no beds, but lay on
the ground on couches of heather or fern. These houses
were built of wattle and daub, and so low that people had
to crawl in on hands and feet and could not stand upright.</p>

<p>"In the best times that class of people seldom could
indulge in animal food, and they were in use to support
themselves in part with the blood taken from their cattle at
different periods, made into puddings or bread with a
mixture of oatmeal. Their common diet was either oatmeal,
barley, or bear, cleared of the husks in a stone trough by a
wooden mallet, and boiled with milk; coleworts or greens
also contributed much to their subsistence, and cabbages
when boiled and mashed with a little oatmeal."<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Potatoes
were introduced in Dumfriesshire some time after 1750, and
the use of lime as manure at about the same time. Even
in 1775 the roads were such that no kind of loaded carriages
could pass without the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>There is a most fascinating account in Dr. Singer's work
of a strong man's difficulties in starting reasonable agriculture
in Dumfriesshire about the year 1785. This was Patrick
Miller, of Dalswinton. (It was on Dalswinton Loch
that he tried the very first steamboat.) "When I went to
view my purchase, I was so much disgusted for eight or ten
days that I then meant never to return to this county. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
trivial accident set me to work, and I have in a great manner
resided here ever since.... I have now gone over all of this
estate, and this I have done without the aid of a tenant....
I need not inform you that the first steps in improvement
are draining when necessary, inclosing sufficiently, removing
stones, roots, rubbish of every kind, and liming.... These
operations cost me, I reckon, about £11 per acre upon an
average; and I lay my account with being repaid all my
expenses by the first three crops, but at any rate by the
fourth. When the land which I make arable will give at
least (if brought from a state of nature) twenty times the
rent when I began to improve it."</p>

<p>Major-General Dirom, of Mount Annan, writing from that
place in 1811, says that all over Scotland for about thirty
years (from 1780-1810) he has seen "cultivation extending
from the valleys to the hills, commons inclosed, wastes
planted, and heaths everywhere giving way to corn: ...
extension of towns and villages, by new lines of excellent
roads, magnificent bridges and inland navigation ... our
rapidly increasing population, by our now exporting great
quantities of grain from parts of Scotland into which it was
formerly imported, and by the superior comfort and abundance
which appear in the domestic economy of the inhabitants."
If you read any newspaper of to-day published in
Canada or in the Argentine Republic, you find exactly
the same process at work, and the same enthusiasm about it.
Even in 1840-1850 all these improvements were still vigorously
going on.</p>

<p>Look at Tennyson's <cite>Northern Farmer</cite> (old style):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i6h">                "'An I a stubb'd Thurnaby waäste.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Even in his days, the good farmer was following King
Alfred's directions. About 1830-1850 most of the land
was in good bearing, and the roads were sufficiently good to
admit of the stage-coach with four horses. But they after
all lasted but a very short time before the railways again
entirely altered the conditions of country life.</p>

<p>As we have seen, rents were in places, five times as large
in 1820-1830 as they had ever been previously.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Therefore
it was that about this time the gentlemen's houses were in
many places rebuilt on a more magnificent scale. Then also
were begun those circles and strips, or belts of plantation,
which are now conspicuous features of the Scotch lowlands.
An enormous majority of these plantations are not more
than eighty years old. I think avenues were planted in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The fashion about
1820 was to destroy them as unnatural, at least in England.
Unfortunately no respect was paid to the economic practice
of forestry, with very unfortunate results for the proprietor.</p>

<p>The rest of this chapter is necessarily unpleasant and distressing
reading, but it is necessary if we are to understand
the romance of the fields. As one wanders over the grassy
pastures of Southern Scotland, where the black-faced sheep
foolishly start away, and where one's ears are irritated by the
scolding complaints of the curlew or whaup, it is no rare accident
to find a few broken-down walls, a clump of nettles,
and badly grown ash trees. That was once a farm steading,
where a healthy troop of children used to play together
after walking three or more miles barefoot to school. The
ash trees were planted at every farm "toon," for the Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
spear was a very necessary weapon until recent times. Often
also, upon some monotonous grouse moor, one sees the ridges
that betoken a little croft where a cottager lived.</p>

<p>In one parish (Troqueer) over seventy country cottages
have been abandoned during the lifetime of a middle-aged
person.</p>

<p>Many families, of which the laird was often the best
farmer in the district and his own factor, have disappeared.
The fine houses, with their parks and shootings, are let to
strangers, who come for a few weeks or months, and then
leave it in charge of a caretaker. Before this recent development,
the "family" lived all the year round upon the land;
they spent their income chiefly in wages to the country
people. Where once forty or fifty people were employed all
the year, there are now but three or four. The big house
with shuttered windows and weed-grown walks, is a distressing
and saddening spectacle.</p>

<p>Of course such changes must occur. The farmer's and the
cottar's children are now carrying out in Canada, Australia,
or the United States, what was done in Scotland from 1780-1830.
India, South Africa, and China have been developed
by the brains and hold the graves of many of the laird's
sons.</p>

<p>Yet this poor old country, abandoned of her children,
shows signs of revival. Both the poor and the rich are
beginning to find out that a country life is healthier,
quite as interesting, and sometimes quite as profitable as the
overcrowded city with its manufactories, mills, and offices.
All new countries are beginning to fill up, and there is some
hope that a new and vigorous development of farming may
make the countryside once more vigorous, prosperous, and
full of healthy children.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE way in which the savage, rugged, inhospitable
Britain of the Ice Age changed into our familiar
peaceful country formed the subject of the last
chapter.</p>

<p>But plants do far more than cover the earth and render it
fertile, for some of them assist in winning new land from the
sea or from freshwater lakes. The Sea of Aral, for instance,
or Lake Tschad are rapidly becoming choked up by reeds
and other vegetation. Blown sand from the deserts around
is caught and intercepted by these reeds, so that fertile
pastures are gradually forming in what used to be the open
water of a deepish lake.</p>

<p>By far the most extraordinary of all these plants which
form new land are the Mangroves.</p>

<p>They are only found in the tropics or sub-tropical regions,
and are always along the sea-coast. It is where a river ends in
a delta, dividing into intricate and confused irregularly
winding creeks, that the mangroves are especially luxuriant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Such a river will have probably flowed through hundreds
of miles of the most exuberant tropical forest, where growth
is never checked by the cold grasp of winter.</p>

<p>Its waters are yellowish brown or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café au lait</i> coloured,
because they are full of mud and of decaying vegetation, with
dead leaves and decaying branches floating on the surface.
So full are such rivers of decaying material that they have
a distinct and unmistakable smell, which has been compared
to "crushed marigolds."</p>

<p>So soon as the muddy water reaches the sea, most of its
mud is deposited and forms great banks and shoals of shifting
odoriferous slime, which confuses and interferes with the
discharging mouths of the river.</p>

<p>It is upon these changing, horrible-smelling banks of
bottomless slime that the Mangrove is especially intended
to develop.</p>

<p>If one takes a canoe in such a delta and paddles inwards
on the incoming tide, a dense forest of glossy-green mangroves
will be found to cover the whole coast-line, and also
to extend far inland by the winding creeks, lagoons, and
river channels.</p>

<p>The whole theory of the mangroves becomes clearly
revealed as soon as the water begins to sink at low tide.
First one notices that the stem of every mangrove ends
below, not in a single trunk, but in an enormous number of
arched, stilt-like supporting roots. Not only the stem but
the branches also give off descending roots, which branch into
four or five grasping arched fingers as soon as they get near
the water. When they reach the mud, these fingers grow
down into it and form a new supporting root to the tree.
It is very difficult to give any idea of the extraordinary
appearance of these mangrove roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Imagine an orchard of very old apple trees in winter, and
suppose that one were to cut off every tree and plant it
upside down in black mud, and also to crowd them so closely
together that the branches were all mixed and confused.
This may give an idea of the odd and strange appearance
of the root-system in a mangrove forest. Upon these arching
roots, even on those which are not yet attached, multitudes
of oysters may be seen. There is also a little fish (a sort of
perch) which climbs up on to the roots or out of the mud
below, and gasps or squatters about in it.</p>

<p>As to the mud itself, it is a horrible, greasy, oozy, black or
blue-black slime of bottomless depth. "It is full of organic,
putrefying, strongly-smelling material, clearly full of bacteria.
The water itself is sometimes covered by a dirty, oily scum,
and air-bubbles rising from the bottom, spread out on the
surface and let loose their microbes in the atmosphere."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
There are many crocodiles, which may be seen reposing on
the mud above high tide. It is difficult to distinguish them
from a rough log of wood, but it is still more difficult to kill
them, for their scales turn any ordinary bullet. There is
scarcely any experience more exasperating than when, after
one has taken a long, careful, and accurate aim, one observes
the sleeping brute suddenly wake and scurry down into the
water with a hideous leer on its face. Sea-cows or manatees
are said to live in these creeks. Little ducks of many kinds
rise in hundreds and thousands, but the commonest bird is
the "curlew" (either a whimbrel or closely allied to it).
During the day they sift the mud with their long curved
beaks for insects, and at sunset fly down in vast numbers to
the mudbanks near the sea. A miserable little white crane
called "Poor Joe" is common, and has the same habit. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
is not worth shooting, and it is quite aware of the fact.
Herons, cormorants, and other birds are often to be seen.
Monkeys sometimes visit the mangroves, probably to eat
oysters or crabs. There are several kinds of crablike
creatures which climb up the roots and may be seen running
about all over them. But during the three weeks spent
by the writer in the Mahéla creeks of Sierra Leone, it was
the insects that made the deepest impression upon him; as
soon as the evening falls the mosquitoes appear in myriads
and in millions. Such creeks and mangrove swamps are
always feverstricken and dangerous, and probably enjoy the
very worst climate in the whole world. Of course nowadays,
when Sir Patrick Manson and Dr. Ross have discovered that
the mosquito carries the malaria germ, it is possible with great
care to guard against malaria. One has also the satisfaction
of knowing that the mosquito itself cannot be perfectly at
ease with all these tiny parasites attacking its digestive
organs.</p>

<p>At first sight such swamps appear to be useless, impossible,
and dangerous. But that is not the case. No one, of course,
would ever willingly reside in mangrove swamps, and the
mangroves themselves are of scarcely any use to man, although
the bark does sometimes furnish a useful tanning
material; but, indirectly, the mangroves are one of the most
important of all Nature's geographical agents.</p>

<p>On those horrible, slimy, shifting mudbanks no other
plants could manage to exist. If one looks carefully at the
seaward side of the last of the mangrove swamps, then it is
easy to see that they are colonizing and reclaiming the mud.</p>

<p>Not only do the roots depending from the branches grasp
and colonize new mud, but the seedlings are also specially
adapted to fulfil the same office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
They remain a long time attached to the parent fruit;
they also grow to a considerable length before they fall off.
When ready to fall, they have a distinct seedling stem, which
swells out towards the base and ends in a pointed root. The
seedling is, in fact, like a club hanging upside down and with
a pointed end. When it does fall, it goes straight down
deep into the mud; then it promptly forms some anchoring
roots, and the young mangrove is fixed in new mud and
begins to develop. So that the forest continually grows
towards the sea.</p>

<p>Such mudbanks soon become pierced by roots in every
direction. Then the leaves of the mangroves themselves,
as well as silt, soil, and rubbish floating in the water,
gradually accumulate about and around these roots. This
must raise the level of the ground. Eventually the soil
becomes hardened and is above the level of the water. When
this happens, the mangrove, which likes salt water about
its roots, becomes unhealthy and the ordinary jungle trees
kill it and take its place. Thus in course of time, when the
jungle is cleared, fertile ricefields may be thriving on what
was once a pure, or rather impure, mudbank.</p>

<p>In this way, by the continual development of the mangroves,
enormous stretches of land are being added to the
continents, and the process continues so long as the
character of the coast-line favours it.</p>

<p>The shore-line covered by these mangrove swamps is
enormous. In fact, within the tropics one finds them almost
everywhere along the seashore, but coral, rock, or an exceedingly
dry climate such as that of Arabia or Northern
Peru, prevents their growth. Central and South America,
West and East Africa, India, Polynesia, Australia, and much
of the Asiatic coast-line, is covered by mangroves.</p>

Theophrastus speaks of those in the Persian gulf, and
that exceedingly shrewd botanist has some valuable notes
about them worth reading even to-day.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In temperate countries, such as our own, the districts
where great rivers enter the sea are for the most part aguish
and rheumatic, but, of course, there is nothing so startling
and extraordinary as the mangrove swamps.</p>

<p>Yet, even in temperate countries, the work of winning or
gaining new land plods steadily onwards, and it is performed
by humble, inconspicuous little plants.</p>

<p>Where the Rhone enters the Mediterranean, there are
some 40,000 acres of sandy and clayey land called the
Camargue. The bare sand near the sea is often flooded and
swept by violent storms in winter; anything which tries to
grow there is usually carried<a name="FNanchor_75-b" id="FNanchor_75-b" href="#Footnote_75-b" class="fnanchor">[75-b]</a> off and destroyed.</p>

<p>[note 75-b: Drude, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>; Schimper, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>; Warming, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>; <cite>Colonial Reports</cite>, No.
3, Miscellaneous. Schimper, <cite>Indo-Malayische Strandflora</cite>.]</p>

<p>But, after a time, one finds here and there a solitary plant
of a kind of Saltwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salicornia macrostachya</i>) which has
withstood the strain: its branches gather a little sand and
hold it together, and its roots gradually explore and tie
down the soil around it. Next winter it can stand the sweep
and scour of the stormy water; next summer other plants
begin to grow on this tiny sand-heap, and the "touradon," as
it is called, is now fairly well established. It goes on growing
until it may be, after a few years, six feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Eventually the salt gets washed out of the soil and these
little heaps become united by a continuous covering of green
plants in which shrubs and then trees begin to grow.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> By this
time of course the sand has accumulated farther out to sea
and the same process is going on there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
In Britain we have the "sea meadows" of Sea-grass,
which covers the submerged sand and mudbanks near the
mouths of great rivers.</p>

<p>The waving green grasslike leaves form a rich submarine
meadow. They are used for stuffing pillows and cushions,
especially in Venice, but their real importance in the world
depends upon their being able to tie down and fix permanently
those unseen shifting banks which form a real
danger to all navigation.</p>

<p>These plants are very remarkable. They lived, no doubt,
at one time on the land, like most of the flowering plants.
But, like the whale and the seal, they have been driven
to take refuge below the ocean. They are not easily seen,
and, indeed, one may wander for years along the sea-coast
and never suspect that great meadows of Zostera (the
Eelwrack, Grasswrack, or Sea-grass) are flourishing under
water.</p>

<p>But, one might ask, how is the pollen of its flowers
carried? Obviously neither insects nor the wind can be
of any service. The pollen of Zostera is, however, of the
same weight exactly as the water, so that it neither rises
to the surface nor sinks to the bottom, but floats to and
fro until it reaches the outspread styles of another plant.
This is perhaps the most remarkable arrangement known for
the carrying of pollen.</p>

<p>Sometimes along the seashore, or especially on the muddy
foreshore of an estuary or tidal river, one can watch those
plants which are trying to form new land. One finds
generally that there is a broad stretch of marshy meadow
interrupted and intersected by small ditches and little
winding streams. As one gets towards the shore, Sea-pink,
Scurvy-grass, an Aster, and other plants, not to be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
elsewhere, become common. Then stretching out into the
mud there are rows of curious reeds and sedges.</p>

<p>Try to pull up one of these reeds, and you will find
a strong, buried, stringy stem, with hundreds of anchoring
roots. These are the pioneers which first fix the sand.</p>

<p>Over the surface of the sand between these upright
stems, one often comes upon a most beautiful, glossy, dark-green,
velvety cushion. It is composed of a seaweed called
Vaucheria, whose twined and interlaced threads form a
thick, silky cushion. But it is only beautiful to look at
from above. If you pull up a piece of this cushion, you
will find that it is growing on black and loathly mud,
with many wriggling worms and horrible animalcula.
First these pioneer reeds, then this soft, silky carpet of
vaucheria, and then the sea-pinks and other estuarine
marsh flowers gradually creep forward and extend over
the bare muddy sand, so winning it from the sea for the use
of cattle.</p>

<p>In the worst winter storms, when the waves are thundering
heavily over these sands, it seems as if nothing
could resist them. Yet if you go down when the storm
is over, no harm has been done: there is the silky green
cushion of vaucheria, and there are the lines of pioneer
sedges and reeds quite undisturbed!</p>

<p>The reeds bend and sway, yielding to the water; the seaweed
is slimy and oily, and the water cannot injure it. But
yet the strength of these seaweeds is extraordinary, and,
indeed, almost incredible.</p>

<p>More remarkable still, perhaps, are those seaweeds
which grow upon rocks, often where the full strength
of the waves beats upon them. After a heavy storm,
when, perhaps, the great timbers of groins and the heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
concrete blocks of an esplanade have been shattered to
pieces and tossed all over the shore, one may go down to
the shore and there will be no visible difference in the kelps
and tangles of the rocks. Scarcely any seem to have
been broken away. Indeed, if one looks in the rubbish
left by the last high tide, one finds that when one of these
Alarias has been broken away, it is often because the stone
itself has been torn out of the rock! One finds broken off
stones with the seaweed still attached to them.</p>

<p>The reason is that the outside of the seaweed is oily,
slimy, or slippery, so that the water gets no hold of it. The
stem and substance is also elastic and surprisingly strong, so
that the daily tossing and wrenching when the tides come in
and go out has no effect in tearing it away.</p>

<p>But if you go down to a dry dock and look at the hull
of a ship which has come in to be cleaned and scraped,
you will see that it is entirely covered by seaweeds and
shells.</p>

<p>That ship has been driven through the water perhaps at ten
miles an hour or more, and yet those delicate-looking seaweeds
have held on! It is more surprising still if you can get
some of them and examine them with a microscope, for
amongst them are tiny, delicate, graceful little fronds and
sprays which one would think consisted of nothing but jelly.
Yet they have been able to thrive and grow on the ship's
hull while it has been hurrying day and night through the
sea, in calm or in tempest, and in currents of hot or cold
water.</p>

<p>Those seaweeds were called by Horace <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Algæ inutiles</i>,
or useless seaweeds; but are they useless?</p>

<p>Go down to a little pool and watch them waving in the
water. Could anything be more beautiful than these little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
graceful red, yellow, or brown sprays? All sorts of seaslugs,
shrimps, and minute animals of weird and wonderful design
are clearly living on them. Fishes live upon these animals,
and fishes are an extremely useful and excellent food for
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="small">ROCKS, STONES, AND SCENERY</span></h2>

<p class="hanging">An old wall&mdash;Beautiful colours&mdash;Insects&mdash;Nature's chief aim&mdash;Hard
times of lichens&mdash;Age of lichens&mdash;Crusts&mdash;Mosses&mdash;Lava flows of
great eruptions&mdash;Colonizing plants&mdash;Krakatoa&mdash;Vesuvius&mdash;Greenland

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T first sight, and when one is striding along at some
four miles an hour, there seems to be nothing at all
interesting in an old wall. But if one stops and carefully
examines the stones, there is a great deal that is
interesting.</p>

<p>Rocks and walls possess a fascination of their own.
Probably at least 2000 British plants are <em>only</em> found upon
them, and yet of these, the vast majority are so small and inconspicuous
that an ordinary person never perceives a single
one of them.</p>

<p>It is perhaps on rocks or old walls near the sea that this
stone flora is most richly developed. The nearly circular
orange-yellow patches of the Lichen <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Physcia parietina</i> are
quite distinct and conspicuous. But any old wall, provided
it is well out in the country, is pretty sure to be interesting.</p>

<p>At first it seems to have only a dull grey or neutral tint.
But if one goes to four or five feet distance, one discovers
that many shades of brown, red, white, and black go to make
this grey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
But the extraordinary beauty of such a wall is only visible
when one peers and scrutinizes the surface very slowly and
carefully with the eyes six or seven inches away from it.</p>

<p>In doing this, one is often troubled by rude and ribald
boys. A botanical friend indeed complained that he had
been for months avoided and shunned as a dangerous wandering
lunatic on account of his botanical enthusiasm. But
true botanists get accustomed to disagreeable incidents like
that, and pay no attention to the vulgar crowd.</p>

<p>The change in an old wall when one looks at it from a few
inches distance is most remarkable. The entire surface is
spotted or dusted, sprinkled or entirely covered by thick
lichen stains and crusts.</p>

<p>The original colour of the stone is nowhere visible. The
lichens show the most delicate shades and contrasts in colour;
all pleasing and all blending together in harmonious general
tones. The fruit of these lichens is like a minute saucer or
platter generally with a thin rim or border, but it is exceedingly
small, probably only one-sixteenth of an inch in
diameter, or even less. The smallest of these crust lichens
form continuous, very thin, coatings, covering the stone;
and against this background the little saucer-like fruits
show up quite distinctly.</p>

<p>The coating itself varies from "bright yellow, pale ochre,
citron, chestnut colour, to mouse colour, different shades of
grey and green, cream colour, lead colour, blue-black or pure
black, tawny, brown, rusty red or pure white." The cups of
one kind (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lecidea</i><a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>) are black, whilst those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lecanora</i> are
generally reddish-brown. But they may be a ghostly pale
hue which stands out plainly against the grey-green background
of the frond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Sometimes they are of the richest deep crimson or lake,
set against a pure snow-white crust. Those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lecanora
vitellina</i> are, though tiny, a brilliant yellow, and quite
startling when first one notices them. Many of these contrasts
and shades are never used by artists, and even from
the mere artistic point of view they have great interest.</p>

<p>But if, after spending a few minutes in carefully looking
over the rocks at a distance of six or seven inches, one stands
up and goes back to four or five feet away, the whole of this
colour scheme fades away and there is only the monotonous
indeterminate grey or neutral tint of the wall.</p>

<p>Now why is this? Why should these delicate and exquisite
shades be wasted on such minute and scarcely distinguishable
forms?</p>

<p>There are always two sides from which one can look at
any subject, namely the <em>inside</em> and the <em>outside</em>.</p>

<p>From the inside (that is from the point of view of the
little lichen itself) these colours are decidedly useful. Small
insects crawl about on such walls or hover a few inches in
front of them, and to those insects these cups will be as conspicuous
and attractive as a scarlet geranium is to ourselves.</p>

<p>Just as we habitually go to look at a geranium, so those
insects fly towards the cups and crawl about on them. Then
when the spores and dust of the lichen begin to stick in
their hairs and feet, they go to a bare place and clean or
brush them off. Thus the spores and dust are carried to a
new part of the rock, where they will grow if they can find
an unoccupied place. The taste in colour of these insects,
moreover, is apparently not very different from that of man.</p>

<p>But perhaps a still more interesting point of view is that
from the outside. Why are those lichens there? What are
they doing, and are they of any use?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
The general scheme of Nature is to cover the whole
world with green, so that every ray of sunlight may find a
working leaf or green frond ready to welcome it and use it.
Nature abhors bare rock, barren sand, and empty water,
and never ceases to try to bring it under that beautiful
covering of green plants and active vegetable life which
supports both man and animals.</p>

<p>We all know that there is a romance in the story of man's
colonies. First the explorer searches out the country; then
the pioneer frontiersman settles and builds his log-hut or
rough shanty. Next comes the frontier village, which may
perhaps in many years' time become a crowded city where
active, valuable work is carried on.</p>

<p>The story of the colonizing of rocks and stones by plants
is just as vividly interesting. These tiny lichens are almost
the first pioneers, and prepare the ground for those that
follow. Upon that bare rock, life is terribly severe. The
frost shatters it, sunshine heats it until it almost burns the
hand in summer. Floods of rain or of sleet beat against it,
and it may be frozen over for weeks.</p>

<p>What plant can stand such conditions? Only these
minute, tiny, scarce visible lichen films!</p>

<p>Gradually new lichen crusts develop upon it. They
cover over the first pioneers; first they suffocate them and
afterwards devour their remains. Nature is very businesslike
and severe in her working. The lichen crust may be now
about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. It is a very slow
process. There is a story of a boy who noticed a patch of
lichen near his father's door. He went away to Kamschatka
or somewhere and came back a very old man of eighty-five
years; but he found that the lichen patch was just the same
size as when he went away. That, however, is just a story!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
At any rate, one of these little crust-lichens called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Variolaria</i>
has been known to increase half a millimetre in size
(about a sixtieth part of an inch) between the end of
February and that of September.</p>

<p>Now if one tries to realize what the life of such a lichen
crust or crottle must be, it is obvious that the stone below
it must be a little corroded or weathered, and remains of the
first choked pioneers, bacteria, and possibly tiny insects or
animalcula will be under the crust, which may now be one-sixteenth
of an inch thick.</p>

<p>It is the turn now of other lichens to colonize it. These
may be the little trumpet or horn and cup lichens, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladonias</i>,
or perhaps the larger grey kinds, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parmelias</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Physcias</i>,
which have leaf-like fronds and form circles of perhaps
eight to ten inches in diameter. The crust-lichen is overgrown,
broken up, disorganized, and devoured by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parmelias</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladonias</i>, who are helped by bacteria, insects, and
animalcula which shelter below them. These leafy lichens
grow much more rapidly.</p>

<p>They may increase two-thirds of an inch in one year.</p>

<p>But very soon after this, one notices a few inconspicuous
green mosses; at first in crevices between the stones or in
hollows, and not remarkable, they soon increase and form trailing
sprays or branches which grow very quickly. Branches
of moss four or five inches long extend over the leafy
lichens in a season. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parmelias</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladonias</i> struggle
on, but they cannot keep pace with the rapid life of the
moss, and soon our wall is covered by beautiful moss turfs.</p>

<p>Underneath such a turf there may be an inch or so of
good soil (dead moss and dust with lichen and insect bodies).
Worms, insects, etc., shelter and flourish and multiply in this
soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
But the turn of the moss is coming. Here a few grass-blades,
there a tiny plant of Sandwort, possibly a Rock Bedstraw,
begin to root themselves in the moss.</p>

<p>If people would only let the wall alone, it would soon be
festooned with hanging plants, and producing quantities of
grass, but somebody is sure to find that it looks very untidy,
and everything is torn off the wall, which again looks new
and raw and clean. Then of course the pioneer lichens begin
again!</p>

<p>Some very interesting and remarkable facts have been discovered
about the way in which lavas and basalts have been
occupied by the plant world.</p>

<p>In the great volcanic eruption of 1883, the whole island of
Krakatoa was covered by hot lava and glowing ashes. In
1884 and 1885 the sunsets were remarkable for a curious
fiery red or orange glow, which was popularly supposed to be
due to the volcanic dust of that explosion. It is said
that the dust travelled three times round the earth, though
I do not know on what authority.</p>

<p>However, on Krakatoa island there was left a clean "slate."
There were neither bacteria, nor leaf-mould, nor living plants
of any kind; no spores or seeds could have endured the fiery
furnace of the eruption.</p>

<p>Three years afterwards the botanist Treub visited the
island. He found that the rocks had been first covered by
thin layers of minute freshwater Algæ, but that ferns were
then occupying and inhabiting the lavas. Eleven kinds of
ferns, and but very few other plants, were discovered.</p>

<p>People were interested in this, and Dr. A. F. W. Schimper
then visited another volcano which had been pouring out
huge streams of lava in 1843. He found that there were
still plenty of ferns, but also numbers of shrubs and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
plants. Yet even then there were no trees, and there was no
continuous mantle of green plants such as we are accustomed
to in this country. He also found many plants growing on
the lava which are generally found on the branches of trees,
that is, which can do without a thick layer of soil. He also
found quantities of a pitcher plant, Nepenthes (which lives
mainly on insects caught in its pitchers).</p>

<p>This does not at first sight seem to agree at all with what
has been given for the walls. It is true that sometimes in the
Highlands, or Lowland and Lakeland Hills, one comes across
quantities of the Bladderfern and others growing on the
"screes." (These last may be described as streams of broken,
angular stones, filling small gullies, and spreading out at the
base over a considerable space.) Often these ferns seem to
be all that can thrive in amongst the stones. But in a mild
and temperate country like our own, one would expect
things to proceed differently.</p>

<p>And in fact they do so. Every one must have noticed a
green stain which covers wet walls, stones, stucco, even
marble statues, and especially tree bark in wet or damp
situations. This is a minute green seaweed rejoicing in the
name of Pleurococcus. It is a pretty object for the microscope.</p>

<p>This, of course, is the first stage of colonization. It is
followed by mosses of sorts.</p>

<p>But there is a more interesting series still in a climate
resembling our own. The lava-flows from Mount Vesuvius
have been investigated by several observers.</p>

<p>There it was found that the first inhabitants were <i>lichens</i>
and small green seaweeds; then "different mosses occupied
the lava over which a certain quantity of vegetable dust had
been scattered." After this, scattered ferns and even small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
shrubs could be seen even on flows which were red-hot only
twenty years before, whilst on old lava-fields herbs, shrubs,
bushes, trees, and even true woods had developed.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Yet in Greenland lava-flows dating from 1724-29 are still
only covered by crust-lichens and a very few of the stone-mosses!
In Sumatra, on the other hand, the volcano of
Tamboro, which in 1815 had entirely destroyed its vegetation,
was covered with a fine young wood in 1874!<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The strong
heat and abundant moisture of Sumatra favours, whilst the
horrible climate of Greenland prevents, the rapid growth of
good soil. Just as cities of 20,000 inhabitants can spring
up in a few months in the Western United States, whilst the
Esquimaux of Greenland have not managed as yet even to
live in villages!</p>

<p>The full beauty of this gradual colonization and occupation
of bare rock and stones only impresses one properly
if one tries to trace the stages, but it is an interesting
history.</p>

<p>Near Glasgow one sees great heaps of shale or blaes
(generally <i>blackband</i>), which are often mistaken for natural
hills. This is or was virgin soil, never occupied by plants,
and entirely destitute of leaf-mould or any sort of organic
plant-food.</p>

<p>If one scrambles to the top of one of these heaps, it is easy
to see all the details of the occupation. Long underground
runners of coltsfoot and of horsetail are climbing up the
sides, fringes of creeping buttercup, couchgrass, and other
hardy weeds occupy, every year, a little more of the flanks,
but, on the top, one very soon finds that the dust of the
atmosphere, aided by weathering, has afforded a chance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
mosses, to hawkweeds, and other rock plants. These in time
cover the top, and soon hardy grasses and weeds form a
regular turf on the top of the shale.</p>

<p>It is interesting to scramble to the top of one of these
heaps, especially in summer. One then begins to realize how
every plant attends strictly to its own business.</p>

<p>All over the sides of the heap there will be hundreds of
a rare groundsel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senecio viscosus</i>), which is not really a
native, and <em>never</em> occurs except on such places. In a grass
field close by hundreds of thousands of Ragwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senecio
jacobæa</i>) make a glorious golden carpet; in the marshy part
of the meadow the Water Ragwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senecio aquaticus</i>) may
be found. In the cottage gardens and here and there
along the roadside the groundsel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senecio vulgaris</i>) is
flourishing abundantly.</p>

<p>These plants never interfere with or encroach upon one
another's grounds. Every year thousands of ragweed and
groundsel seeds must be blown on to the shale-heap, but
they never manage to grow there.</p>

<p>It is only the foreigner (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. viscosus</i>), accustomed to a very
hot and dry climate, and with sticky leaves which catch atmospheric
dust and probably insects, that can exist on the bare
shaly sides. These slopes of shale are easily heated by the
sun, and at the same time radiate the heat rapidly away, so
that the Viscid Groundsel must have a very hard time of it.
When its roots have worked up the shale a little, and its
dead leaves have covered the surface with mould and organic
matter, then possibly others (true British plants) can get
a footing and suppress it.</p>

<p>Along railway tracks, also, the ballast forms a very hot,
a very dry, and a very barren soil. Many of the regular
railway-track plants are foreigners from the far south, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
from the sunny shores of the Mediterranean. They are
mostly annuals, such as the little Toadflax (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Linaria minor</i>),
which can just manage to exist under those conditions.</p>

<p>Of course, the sides of the banks and of cuttings on railways
are generally formed of good earth or soil, and support
a rich and flourishing flora of true Britons.</p>

<p>Besides these slow, laborious lichens, mosses, and others
which attack rock, there are other plants which are generally
called rock plants, though they behave quite differently.</p>

<p>These are those fine hardy Hawkweeds, Roseroots, Sempervivums,
Mew, and others which establish their roots in cracks
or crevices of the rocks.</p>

<p>Such cracks are soon full of good soil, for the wind blows
decayed leaves and dust into them, and the roots are always
burrowing into, eating into, and shattering the rocks.
Most of them have a circle of leaves which are pressed flat
to the ground. Thus they escape the violent winds and
storms always common on such crags and precipices. The
flowers, however, supported on tough, strong, and flexible
stalks, sway freely to and fro in the wind, and can be seen by
insects a long way off.</p>

<p>These rock plants are of some importance as stonebreakers
and pioneers in a very interesting process.</p>

<p>Wherever a cliff or precipice of stone is exposed, it is
"weathered." Water gets into the cracks and freezes in
winter. But when water is frozen it expands or widens, and
as this happens to the water in the crevices and cracks of
rocks, pieces of rock are shivered and broken off. Besides
frost and wind and rain, these rock plants help to attack
the cliff. Their roots get into the crevices, and there
widen and expand, tearing off great slabs and splinters of
rock which fall down to the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Down below plants are every year growing over and
covering up or "happing up" with green these bare fragments
and splinters. A considerable amount falls down every year,
so that the ground is always being raised up below the
precipice. At the brow or edge above the precipice, there is
also always a loss of rock and stone every year.</p>

<p>So that every year the bare rock exposed becomes smaller
and smaller, until eventually a steep, green, grass-covered
slope covers over the entire site of that precipice.</p>

<p>Moreover that is not by any means all that plants do in the
way of changing the scenery of the country. Look at the outlines
of the hills in any part of Great Britain except in the
broken, jagged, rocky mountain ranges of Scotland and
Wales (also Cumberland, Westmorland, parts of Derbyshire
and Dartmoor tors). Everywhere there are smooth,
flowing, gently undulating rises and falls. No sharp, abrupt
descents break these graceful sweeping curves. If you compare
the scenery of a cañon in the rainless deserts of Western
America, the contrast is very striking. There the sides of the
valleys are steep cliffs; it is all harsh, precipitous, horrible
country, which is obviously very unpleasant and very unattractive
to civilized people.</p>

<p>It is this green covering of plants which makes the
difference. The rain that falls is not allowed to cut out
ragged ravines; it is intercepted and soaks into the grasses,
which so keep a smooth, gentle outline over hill and valley.</p>

<p>If you notice the effect of a heavy shower of rain on a road
or bare earth, you will see how soon tiny valleys and cañons
and beds of streamlets are cut out. But on the green fields
beside the road, there is no change in the surface at all! It
seems to be quite unaffected by the heaviest storm of rain.</p>

of animals.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>Y far the greater number of wild animals live by eating
vegetables. If one thinks of the elephant's trunk,
the teeth of a hippopotamus, or even of the jaws and
lips of mice, rats, and voles, the thoroughly practical character
and efficiency of their weapons become the more astonishing
the more one reflects upon them.</p>

<p>Yet the defences adopted by plants are just as wonderful,
and are often most ingenious.</p>

<p>It seems at first remarkable that the most usual food of
animals, grass, should be apparently unprotected. It is upon
grass that the great herds of bison, of buffalo, of antelope,
and guanaco, are or were supported. Yet grass is so wonderfully
reproductive, produces such enormous quantities of
buds and foliage, and grows in such luxuriance, that there is
no fear of its being killed out.</p>

<p>There are many places in the world where vegetation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
defies the attacks of the animal world. Neither man nor
elephant can live comfortably in the thick jungles of
West Africa and the great forests of Brazil. Nor can
either man or elephant utilize great tracts of country in
Central Africa which are covered by the Elephant Grass.</p>

<p>For, perhaps, four or five hours the weary caravan plods
on through a sort of burrow, two feet wide, made in this
gigantic grass. The stems are ten feet or more in height,
and nearly meet overhead. There is nothing whatever to be
seen except the narrow path. The atmosphere is stifling and
hot. To cut a new road a few hundred yards long through
it involves hours of labour. It is only when there has been
a long drought that it is possible to set fire to the Elephant
Grass, and then for a very short time the young growing
shoots can be grazed. But no cattle can break through when
it is fully grown.</p>

<p>The very exuberance of vegetation in such cases prevents
any harm.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is best to show how, even in Great Britain, all
plants have many dangerous foes. The roots of trees are
nibbled by mice, voles, and sometimes by swine. The bark
is injured by cattle, roedeer, reddeer, fallowdeer, who
tear the bark with their horns, and especially by rabbits
and hares. The leaves are eaten by the same animals and
also by horses, goats, sheep, etc. The young buds are
attacked by squirrels, who also break off the leading shoots
of certain firs when they happen to be in a playful mood.</p>

<p>But it is in cultivated lands and in open, rather dry and
arid country that one finds the most interesting weapons in
the fights between plant and animal. It is in such places
that some of the most beautiful and useful creatures have
their home. The horse, ass, camel, goat, and sheep probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
belong to those wonderful lands which border the great
deserts of Africa and Asia. These animals have been
obliged to travel far and fast, and to perfect their bodily
strength in order to pick up a living.</p>

<div><a name="cultivated_bamboo_in_a_chinese_plantation" id="cultivated_bamboo_in_a_chinese_plantation"></a></div>

<p class="smcap">Cultivated Bamboo in a Chinese Plantation</p>
<p>These giant grasses are sometimes one hundred and twenty feet high and one foot in
diameter. They at times grow at the rate of three feet per day, and are used for all sorts
of purposes, such as scaffolding poles, flower-pots, as a vegetable, etc. etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p>They have been taught (perhaps we should say learnt) by
the thorns and briers of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Cactus, Prickly Pears, or other succulent plants which
belong to true deserts, are covered over with most curious
and interesting spines. A row of little projections runs
down each edge of the round fleshy stem. On each projection
there is a rosette of spines. Sometimes these are long,
slender, and diverging; in other cases they are short, stout,
and curving over.</p>

<p>Now imagine a guanaco in South America, or even a rat
or mouse, which is perishing of thirst in the arid desert
where such things are found. It will be seen that it is by
no means easy for it to taste the water in the juicy stem, for
even the thin muzzle of a rat could scarcely get between the
thorns.</p>

<p>Kerner describes how the wild asses in South America
root up or try to split the Cacti with their hoofs to get at
the juicy tissue of the unarmed lower parts. Yet they
often receive dangerous wounds in doing so from the frightful
spines of Melocactus<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and others.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to see a flock of Angora goats in
South Africa attacking an Acacia. The kid is a pretty,
white, fluffy little creature, with the most meek, mild, and
innocent expression. Yet it is a quarrelsome little brute.
In a few minutes an Acacia will be despoiled, broken, and
robbed of its foliage by a flock of them, although it bristles
all over with long spines, of which there are a pair at the base
of each leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Even the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Kameeldorn</i>, Camelthorn Acacia, or the Wait-a-bit
in South Africa cannot defend itself.</p>

<p>The Wait-a-bit (<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wacht een beetje</i>) is so called from the
ingenious nature of its spines. There are two together, of
which one is straight and the other curved round like a hook.
Both are very sharp and strong, so that an incautious traveller
is sure to injure himself and his clothes. The straight one
runs into his tender flesh, whilst the curved one fixes itself in
his clothes.</p>

<p>It is by thorns, spines, and prickles that plants often
protect themselves against the attacks of grazing animals.
But it must be remembered that these are by no means the
only safeguard. Plants produce poisonous, bitter, or strong-smelling
substances which keep off their enemies, and these
indeed often afford a more efficient protection (see Chap. <span class="smcap">III.</span>).
These thorns, etc., can be produced in the most unexpected
places. There is one rule, however, namely that they are
invariably found in the exact spot where they can be most
useful.</p>

<p>Thus there are certain palms which possess green, juicy
leaves, much relished by snails. These are protected by a
sort of spine entanglement formed upon certain roots,
which grow at the base of the leaves. Nor is this the only
case in which spines are found on roots. There are certain
South African bulbs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moræa</i>) which are protected from the
wild pigs by a dense mass of spiny roots.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> On my march to
Uganda from Mombasa, I was very much astonished to see
an extraordinary Wild Yam. It had a huge underground
tuberous part full of starchy matter, but it was quite impossible
for any marauding wild boar to get at it, for it was
entirely enclosed in a sort of arbour of long, arching roots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
densely covered by stout spines, which made a perfect
protection.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>It is more usual to find thorns developed on the branches
or stems. Generally these are formed on the outside towards
the end of the branches. In the Alps, larches have to suffer
from the attacks of goats which nibble off the ends of the
young shoots. The part behind the scar dries up, but fresh
twigs are put out from further back along the branch, until
the tree becomes a closely branched, twiggy, bristling mass
which looks like the clipped yews in old gardens. But so soon
as it has grown tall enough to be above the reach of the
goats, an ordinary larch stem develops and may grow into
quite a respectable tree. This fact is given by Kerner von
Marilaun (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>, p. 445), and is very instructive, as explaining
why it is that so often the ends of the branches become hard
thorns: the green leaves and twigs are hidden and protected.</p>

<p>One of the neatest examples of this is the Portuguese
Gorse or Whin, which resembles a little cushion with every
branch ending in strong thorns and every leaf terminated by a
stout spine.</p>

<p>The common Whin, Furze, or Gorse, is very nearly as perfect
an example of thorniness and spininess. The Southdown
sheep do not seem to injure it on those beautiful
Sussex downs so famous for succulent mutton, yet in the
early spring, or in a very wet season, one often finds in the
grass at the foot of the bush (or even in the bush itself)
small shoots which would be taken at first sight as belonging
to some other plant. These little shoots are grey with hairs
and have soft trefoil leaves which are quite unprotected, for
their spines are quite soft. They are probably seldom eaten,
for most of them are in the shelter of the old spiny bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Yet even the old bushes can be used as fodder for sheep if
they are crushed and ground up so as to break the thorns
and spines. The Gorse is a very hardy plant, and is said to
be only out of flower "when kissing is out of fashion" (see
p. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>).</p>

<p>There is still some uncertainty as to the exact way in
which animals set to work when they are eating thorny
or spiny bushes. This makes the arrangement of the
thorns sometimes a little difficult to follow. Moreover it is
often not so much the leaves as the juicy bark in winter and
early spring that is required. Sometimes everything above
ground is eaten down.</p>

<p>Rabbits, for instance, do not as a rule touch the Hawthorn,
yet Mr. Hamilton says, "The second winter after planting
was very severe and this hedge was eaten down to the very
ground by rabbits. For about 600 yards I do not think that
a single plant was missed."<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In frost and snow almost every
plant is attacked by rabbits, and indeed by any grazing
animal.</p>

<p>Remembering that it is very often the young juicy shoots
that are sought after, it is quite easy to see why the young
Rose suckers and shoots from the base of the stem fairly
bristle with long and short prickles. These latter are
generally straight, not curved like those of the long arching
branches which are supposed to hook themselves on the
branches of the surrounding trees. The young light-coloured
branches of the cultivated Gooseberry are flexible, and hang
over in such a way as to make it difficult for an animal to
reach the bark: a cow or sheep, if it wished to eat these
branches, would begin at the hanging tip and make a sort of
upward tearing jerk while its tongue gathered the branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
into its mouth. If one copies this with the hand it is easy
to see how the length and arrangement of the prickles and
the flexible nature of the spray would make such a proceeding
on the cow's part most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>So also in the Barberry, the young juicy upright shoots
which spring from the older branches have stout three to
seven-branched prongs pointing downwards, of the most
efficient character. Each is really a modified leaf and is
found below each bud. Even the mere idea of an animal's
tender lips or tongue tearing at these shoots from below
gives one a momentary shudder. In the younger, wavy
branches of the Barberry the spines are straighter or more
diverging. The young leaves of the short bud above
alluded to are also most efficiently protected by their spines.
The Hawthorn has a curious arrangement of very long stout
thorns, behind which the leaves are sheltered. The younger
flexible branches have smaller spines, which become efficient
in winter and tend to prevent animals from eating the bark.
The Cockspur thorns are 4 to 5-1/2 inches long, and extremely
like the spur of a gamecock.</p>

<p>Bramble prickles are generally curved back in order to
hook or cling to the branches of other trees, but any one
who has tried to force his way through a clump of brambles
knows the difficulty of doing so. The loops made by the
branches fixing themselves in the ground (see p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>) were
at one time given credit for healing various diseases. Children
in Gloucestershire used to be dragged backwards and
forwards under these loops; in Cornwall also people afflicted
with boils were made to crawl under them. Even cows
when suffering from paralysis (supposed to be due to a
shrew-mouse walking over them) were dragged through the
Bramble-loop, in which case Professor Buckman remarks, "If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
the creature could wait the time of finding a loop large
enough and suffer the dragging process at the end, we
should say the case would not be so hopeless as that of our
friend's fat pig, who, when she was ailing, had a mind to kill
her to make sure on her."<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The brambles and briers
of Gilead and Ezekiel were probably brambles of which
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubus discolor</i> is common in Palestine,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the Butcher's
Broom (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ruscus aculeatus</i>). This last plant is really of the
Lily family, and its flat leaf-like branches end in a sharp
spine. The rabbit does not eat it.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Amongst foreign thorny and spiny plants it is very
difficult to make a selection.</p>

<p>Theophrastus (one of the very earliest botanists&mdash;see
p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>) describes a class of shrub very common in Phrygia, in
which the leaves are produced at the base of the young shoots,
which latter end at the top in branch thorns. These thorns,
therefore, entirely cover the foliage and keep off that
vegetable demon the goat. Some of the Crucifers, Roses,
Composites, Labiates, etc., take on this habit in goat-infested
countries.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In Egypt, near the Pyramids, one often finds <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carlina
acaulis</i>, a little thistle which has no stem, but is merely a
flower seated in the middle of a rosette of leaves which lie
flat on the sand. In the centre there is a circle of sharp
spines, each of which is from one to two inches in length.
The nostril of a hungry camel or donkey is sure to be pierced
if it tries to eat the leaves. The spines of this thistle, like
those of our Carline and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centaurea calcitrapa</i> (thistle of
the Bible), spring from the bracts surrounding the flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
The ancient "calthrops" or "crawtaes" (first used by the
Romans) were designed from the spines of the last-named
plant<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calx</i>, heel, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trappa</i>, snare.) It had four iron
spines, so that, however it was thrown down on the ground
or in a ford, a spine was sure to stick up and to lame man or
horse.</p>

<div><a name="calthrops" id="calthrops"></a></div>

2, 3. Fruits of Tribulus, showing efficient spines. Animals' feet, in passing,
must catch them. They are more efficient than Calthrops.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Tragacanth plant has also very neat spines. They are
the persistent spiny stalks or midribs of the older leaves
from which the leaflets have dropped away. The fresh green
leaflets are quite protected inside these withered spines.</p>

<p>Several grasses have leaves which end in sharp or needlelike
points. One of these, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Festuca alpestris</i>, actually produces
bleeding at the nostrils of grazing cattle, and is
detested by all the shepherds of the Alps.</p>

<p>The Holly is one of our most beautiful trees, as
John Evelyn points out: "This <em>vulgar</em> but <em>incomparable</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
tree.... Is there under <em>Heaven</em> a more glorious and refreshing
object of the kind than an impregnable <em>hedge</em> of near
<em>three hundred</em> feet in <em>length</em>, <em>nine</em> foot <em>high</em> and <em>five</em> in
<em>diameter</em>: which I can show in my poor <em>Gardens</em> at any time
in the year, glittering with its arm'd and vernished <em>leaves</em>?
The taller <em>Standards</em> at orderly distances blushing with their
natural <em>Coral</em>."<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> This apparently was the identical hedge
into which Peter the Great used to trundle his wheelbarrows.
The barrows contained his courtiers. There was
a nice run from the top of rising ground close at hand. It
was at Sales Court, Deptford.</p>

<p>The spiny leaves of the Holly are unfortunately not
nearly strong enough to save it from its enemies. The bark
is apparently of a particularly delicious and toothsome
nature, for sheep, cattle, and the ubiquitous rabbit are
always delighted to destroy the trees.</p>

<p>It has been noticed that wild hollies have at the base
very spiny leaves, but that higher up on the tree (above
the reach of cattle) the leaves have no spines at all. Sir
Herbert Maxwell, in his <cite>Memories of the Months</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> takes up
this question. It is best to give the description in his own
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I strolled out along the banks of Tay in that noble woodland
which is continuous from Dunkeld to Murthly. Here
there are many fine hollies, some on the river banks and
cliffs, others on level ground, planted by no hand of man.
There was not one of these which did not confirm my
observations first made many years ago, and hardly one
which did not bear evidence of special growth&mdash;not merely
as a reaction against pruning or cropping, but <em>as a precaution</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
<em>against any such contingency</em>&mdash;so regular and deliberate
as to suggest that these trees are something more
than unconscious automata.</p>

<p>"Many of these hollies are thirty feet high, with foliage
down to the ground. They carry spinous leaves up to a
height of three or four feet; above that level all the foliage
is absolutely smooth and spineless. One tree rose from the
ground in two bare stems, and the lower branches did not
reach below the browsing level. But from between the two
old stems rose a young shoot about four feet long, clothed
throughout its entire length with intensely prickly leaves.
This tree was growing in an enclosed wood where cattle
could not come; still, roedeer might be about, and the holly
armed its young growth at the low level, although the
leaders of the old stems, not less vigorous in growth, bore
leaves as smooth as a camellia's. I noted one particularly
suggestive tree, an unhealthy one. The growth had died
back along most of the branches, which stood out bare and
dry; but a recuperative effort was in progress; fresh and
luxuriant growth was bursting along nearly the whole
height of the stem, and the foliage of this was vigorously
prickly up to about four feet, and smooth above that height.
I noticed many instances of localised prickly growth where
boughs, originally above the browsing level, and clothed
with spineless leaves, had been weighed down and cropped
by cattle. But this is merely a vigorous reaction against
external injury, such as makes a clipped holly hedge bear
spinous foliage from base to summit."<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>This quotation shows that there is no doubt as to the
facts. It is true that one finds cultivated hollies showing
many variations. Sometimes all the leaves are spiny, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
above and below. In other varieties none of the leaves
possess spines at all. Yet it must be admitted that these
are facts and cannot be denied.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the Osmanthus, with its holly-like leaves, the
Evergreen Oak, and some Junipers are found to show exactly
the same curious difference. The perilously-situated lower
leaves are more spiny than those which are above the reach
of grazing animals.</p>

<p>Kerner von Marilaun<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> also has remarked a similar protective
arrangement in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gleditschia chinensis</i> and in the Wild
Pear. Trees of the latter, when they are young, "bristle
with the spines into which the ends of the woody branches
are transformed"; but tall trees twelve to fifteen feet high
are entirely without thorns!</p>

<p>It is when one meets coincidences of this nature that the
full meaning of plant life begins to dawn upon the mind.</p>

<p>How is it that the plant knows the time to produce its
spines, and the time to refrain from doing so?</p>

<p>There are certain queer facts that have been given on
good authority as to the causes which tend to produce
thorniness and spininess.</p>

<p>Linnæus, <cite>Philos. Bot.</cite>, p. 215, § 272, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Spinosae arbores cultura saepius deponunt spinas in
hortis." Lothelier found that Barberries grown in a moist
atmosphere had no spiny leaves, and that the thorns were far
less woody under those conditions, whilst in a perfectly arid
and dry atmosphere only spines were formed; a strong light
also tended to produce spines.</p>

<p>Professor Sickenberger grew a desert plant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zilla myagroides</i>)
in the Botanic Garden at Cairo, and found that its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
spines were much weaker and more slender than the strong
rigid thorns which cover it in its natural desert.</p>

<p>Professor Henslow<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> found that the spiny form of the Rest
Harrow, when grown in a rich soil with an abundance of
water, gradually loses its spines. All these experiments
certainly show that a dry desert sort of life, and possibly
strong sunlight, favour the development of spines and
thorns.</p>

<p>Of this there cannot be any reasonable doubt, for the
extraordinary quantity of thorny, spiny things in deserts
shows that there must be some connexion between such
a life and their production (see Chapter <span class="smcap">X.</span>). In such
places animals are always abundant. But these hollies,
pears, and other plants show exactly the opposite to what
we should expect. It is when the head of the young holly
reaches the sunlight and feels the wind that its leaves
become harmless!</p>

<p>If one remembers the case of the young larch and its goat
enemies on page <a href="#Page_181">181</a>, it is perhaps possible to think that the
lower branches and twigs were for untold generations exposed
to laceration and biting. Thus, suffering from the loss of
water by these regular annual wounds, the leaves developed
their spines in response. So far, belief is not more difficult
than it is with regard to the origin of any variety. But
whenever, by reversion to their ancestral type, the original
not-spiny leaves developed on the top of a tree, that tree
would have an advantage, for every leaf on it would be more
economically produced; a smooth leaf would not require to
spend food in order to make spines. Such trees, spiny below
and smooth above, would be best fitted to survive, healthier
and more vigorous, and in the end would leave more
descendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
At the same time, such a case as this reveals again that
mysterious and exquisite purposefulness which a reverent
mind discovers in Nature everywhere.</p>

<p>At the same time, as we have already pointed out, we are
exceedingly ignorant of many of the very commonest facts.
Léo Errera, the great Belgian botanist (whose recent death
has been a terrible loss to science), collected together some
facts as to the taste of cattle for various spiny and thorny
plants; he found that cattle wished to eat the following:
Buckthorn, whin or gorse, raspberry, brambles, the Scotch
thistle, the creeping thistle, as well as musk, welted and
slender thistles, sow thistle, and saltwort.</p>

<p>They avoided: Barberry, the petty and German whin, rest
harrow, the carline, and the other thistles not given above,
as well as the common juniper.</p>

<p>They disdained or despised: Sea holly, common holly,
milk thistle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lactuca</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urtica urens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>So far as the holly is concerned, it is certainly not
despised by sheep and rabbits in this country. But how few
are the plants investigated! Several of the commonest
British plants are omitted just because no one has taken the
trouble to watch them.</p>

<p>Here, then, is an opportunity of discovering something
new, fresh, and interesting which should be well within the
reach of any one who passes his life in the country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="small">ON NETTLES, SENSITIVE PLANTS, ETC.</span></h2>

plants&mdash;Mechanism&mdash;Plants alive, under chloroform and
ether&mdash;Telegraph plant&mdash;Woodsorrel&mdash;Have plants nerves?&mdash;Electricity

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE common nettle is one of our most interesting
British plants. It is exposed to great danger; one
sees it growing not only in pastures and parks,
but in waste places, along roadsides, and near cultivated
ground. Yet it is very seldom either eaten or even
touched. Cattle do occasionally eat the young shoots. But
this is exceptional, for even in fields where there are plenty
of cattle great clumps of nettle luxuriate and increase in
size every year.</p>

<p>The stinging hairs are hollow and shaped rather like a
narrow bulb or flask; the tip is slightly bent over and
rounded (not sharp); the hairs contain formic acid. If one
grasps the nettle or strokes it in a particular way (from
below upwards) the hairs are pressed flat against the stem or
broken, so that no wound is made by them in the skin and
consequently they do no harm. But if the point of the hair
pierces the skin, the well-known irritation is set up. That
is because formic acid is poured into the wound. Besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the stinging hairs which keep off all the larger animals
(including man) there are others, shorter and thickly set,
which do not sting at all, but are intended to keep off snails.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The pain produced by our common nettle is, however,
a very trifling matter compared with that produced by some
of the foreign species. One of the Indian kinds was used to
excite and irritate bulls when they were intended to fight
with tigers in the games which used to be held at some
Indian Courts. Another found in Timor is called the Devil's
Leaf; the effect of its sting may last for twelve months and
may even produce death. But a still more dangerous stinging
plant is a handsome tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laportea moroides</i>) found in
Australia. It is often 120-140 feet high, and has fine dark-green
leaves often one foot in length. The sting is so
powerful that even horses are killed by touching its leaves.
The sting of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jatropha urens</i> is so strong that people become
unconscious. In Java also the sting of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urtica stimulans</i>
continues to smart for twenty-four hours, and may produce
a fever which is very difficult to shake off.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Yet our common nettle is the favourite food-plant of the
caterpillars of the Small Tortoiseshell, Red Admiral, Peacock,
Camberwell Beauty, and other butterflies.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> These caterpillars
are possibly more intelligent than many of our country folk,
who do not know that the nettle is a very useful plant, as
the following statements most clearly prove. Its young leaves
make an excellent spinach, and it was, according to Sir
Walter Scott, formerly cultivated in Scotland as a pot-herb.
Pigs, turkeys, geese, and fowls like the leaves when they are
chopped up. It is said that the dried leaves and seeds will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
make hens lay in winter time. The seeds, under pressure,
yield quite a good oil. A yellow dye can be obtained by
boiling the roots with alum. An excellent string can also
be made from the inner bark of the stems, which has, in
fact, been used to make twine and even clothing. The
nettle is also valuable as an external stimulant in cases of
paralysis.</p>

<p>A plant with so many wonderful properties would not be
so common as it is, or so little disturbed, if it were not for
its powerful stings.</p>

<p>There are one or two plants which are extremely like the
nettle at first sight. Lord Avebury has an illustration in
his excellent little book<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> in which it is most difficult to tell
which are White Deadnettles and which are stinging nettles.
No doubt the harmless deadnettle is helped to escape injury
by this resemblance. The Hemp Deadnettle and some
Campanulas are also very like it when growing. These also
are sham nettles and may escape in the same way.</p>

<p>There are several common greenhouse Primulas which also
produce irritation of the skin. When handled by gardeners
a painful smart is set up which lasts for some time. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primula
obconica</i> is the worst of these, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. sinensis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. cortusoides</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. Sieboldii</i> sometimes have the same effect. In all
these cases it is due to a peculiar secretion of certain glandular
hairs.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The methods of protection against grazing animals so far
described, such as stinging hairs, thorns, spines, etc. (see
page <a href="#Page_190">190</a>), are obvious enough, but perhaps the most
ingenious system of defence is that exhibited by the Sensitive
Plant and a few others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
When man or any heavy animal is approaching certain
Indian plants, their leaves suddenly drop, and the leaflets close
together. The mere shaking of the ground or of the air produces
these extraordinary movements in the sensitive Woodsorrel
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oxalis sensitiva</i>), in two Leguminous plants (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Smithia
sensitiva</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aeschynomene indica</i>), and in several Mimosas.</p>

<p>When one leaf-tip of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimosa pudica</i>, the Sensitive Plant
(<i>par excellence</i>), is touched or injured, a series of changes
begin. All the little leaflets shut up one after the other; then
the secondary stalks drop; after this the main stalk of the
leaf suddenly droops downwards. After a short interval, the
next leaf above goes through identically the same movements.
If the shaking or injury is severe, every leaf from below
upwards moves in the same way.</p>

<p>One probable advantage of these movements can be understood
from the behaviour of flies, which alight upon the
leaves and make them drop. The flies are startled and go
away. Grazing animals will consider such behaviour in a
vegetable as very uncanny, and will probably go to some
other less ingeniously protected plant.</p>

<p>Of course such extraordinary behaviour has been a challenge
to the botanical world, and there is an overwhelming
mass of speculation, and observations about the Sensitive
Plant.</p>

<p>It has been proved that the movements are caused by the
thickened part at the base of the main stalk of the leaf.
This is swollen, and full of water, and much thicker than
the stalk itself. It is by this thickened portion that the leaf
is kept at its proper angle. When the tip of the leaf is
shaken or injured, the cells on the under side of this swollen
part allow their water to exude into the spaces between
them, and in consequence down comes the leaf-stalk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
This is not, by any means, a full or even a sufficient
explanation. There is certainly some peculiar sending of
messages from the tip of the leaf to the swollen part itself.
It is not safe to say that it is a nerve message, but the
process resembles the way in which messages are sent by
the nerves in animals. Not only so, but the contraction of
the under side and a corresponding expansion on the upper
side, resembles the muscular movements of contraction and
expansion in animals.</p>

<p>It must always be remembered that plants are alive; their
living matter is not in any way (so far as we know) essentially
different from that of animals or of man. Their living
matter (protoplasm) in leaf-stalks and leaves is cut up into
boxes or cells, each enclosed in a case or wall of its own.
Yet these are not entirely independent and unconnected, for
thin living threads run from cell to cell, so that there is an
uninterrupted chain of protoplasm all along the leaf, leaf-stalk,
and stem.</p>

<p>In this particular case of the Sensitive Plant, the leaves at
night regularly take up the position which they adopt when
injured or shaken during the daytime.</p>

<p>The easiest way to produce the shrinking of the leaves is,
as has been mentioned, to hold a lighted match a little below
the leaf-tip. Severe shaking, a strong electric shock, or a
railway journey will also produce closing of the leaves.</p>

<p>Under chloroform or ether, or if the atmospheric pressure
is suddenly diminished, the leaves will also fall. In some respects
they are very lifelike, for if too often stimulated they
become "fatigued," and will not react unless a sufficient
interval of rest is allowed them.</p>

<p>The reaction occurs very soon if the plant is in good condition:
in less than one second it begins, and the leaf-stalk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
may fall in two to five seconds, but the recovery is very
slow.</p>

<p>Vivisection is a cruel sort of proceeding, although it may
sometimes be necessary. The most curious vivisections have
been performed on Mimosa. When the leaflets are cut off, it
is possible, on a stimulus being applied, to see water oozing
out of the cut surface of the stalk. This would go to show
that it is the water being discharged from the leaf-base that
produces the movement.</p>

<p>There are, however, many points in the behaviour of the
Sensitive Plant which have not yet been explained.</p>

<p>Possibly the curious Semaphore or Telegraph Plants,
whose leaflets suddenly and without any obvious reason move
with a jerk through an angle of several degrees, may also
be protected from animals by this uncanny and unusual
behaviour.</p>

<p>But though the Sensitive Plant is certainly protected from
grazing animals by these movements, other advantages may
be derived. Heavy rain, for instance, such as occurs in the
tropics, will not injure its delicate leaves. Dust-storms will
not damage it, and at night there will be no loss of heat by
radiation. The "shrunk" or folded condition of the leaflets
will decrease any chance of injury by raindrops, for the rain
will not fall on the broad surface of the leaflets. A nearly
vertical leaf also will not suffer the loss of heat which
a horizontal one would endure.</p>

<p>Besides the plants mentioned above, there are several others
in which by a rather severe shaking the leaves can be made to
fold up. This is the case with the common Woodsorrel
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oxalis acetosella</i>), with the False Acacia (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robinia</i>), and a
few others.</p>

<p>The former has a peculiarly delicate leaf. In cold, wet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
weather its leaflets hang limp and numb from the leaf-stalk
all day. In fine weather they are spread out horizontally.
On a fine sunny afternoon its leaflets may sometimes take a
mid-day sleep, for they hang loosely down in the same way
that they do in cold, wet weather or at night.</p>

<p>But in the Woodsorrel these movements are not for protection
against grazing animals.</p>

<p>There are other examples amongst plants of a distinct
sudden movement which begins whenever part of the plant
is touched. The movements of tendrils have been already
referred to. The Venus' Fly Trap and the Sundew will be
mentioned when we are discussing Insectivorous Plants.
There are also several flowers in which the stamens suddenly
spring up when they are touched by an insect (Barberry,
Centaurea, and Sparmannia), and in Mimulus the style-flaps
close when touched (see p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>).</p>

<p>All these cases seem to involve some sort of mechanism
which replaces the nervous system of animals.</p>

<p>No very definite laws have yet been discovered as to the
way in which plants are affected by electricity, but enough is
known to show that there are many interesting discoveries in
prospect.</p>

<p>Professor Lemström has made some interesting experiments
in the Polar regions which go to show that the rich development
of plant life in that desolate region may be connected
with the peculiar electrical conditions of the Polar atmosphere;
the aurora borealis, which is a common phenomenon
there, being also produced by those conditions.</p>

<p>Several writers have claimed that slight electric shocks
given at frequent intervals help the growth of plants and
especially quicken the germination of seeds, but it can
scarcely be said that this has been proved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
When a branch or leaf-stalk is wounded or injured by being
tightly clamped in a vice, then it will be found that a
current of electricity passes from the injured spot to the
part that is untouched, and then in the reverse direction.</p>

<p>Changes of current are also produced when a leaf is
suddenly exposed to light for a short time and then shaded.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting observations is that made by
Major Squiers near Lorin Station, in America, where the
California Gas and Electric Corporation of San Francisco
has a long-distance transmission telegraph line. The power
is transmitted at a voltage of 56,000 with a frequency of
sixty cycles per second (three-phase). Major Squiers, from
previous experiments, thought that a note corresponding to
this frequency might be heard in a telephone receiver. The
following was the result:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon connecting the telephone between two nails driven
in any growing tree along the route of the line, and at
a reasonable distance therefrom, the telephone responded to
this note with great clearness, and when the distance was not
more than 100 feet, the sound was very loud. For this
experiment no microphone need be used, nor any source of
electromotive force other than that induced in the tree itself,
the telephone being connected directly between two nails
driven into the tree....</p>

<p>"Several kinds of trees of various sizes and forms were
examined along this power transmission line, and all were
found to be singing with a loud voice the fundamental note
characteristic of the line current. Indeed, the strip of
vegetation along this line has thus been singing continuously,
day and night, for several years, since the operation of the
line began; it needed only the electro-magnetic ear to make
the sound apparent....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
"The general appearance of vegetation along this route is
certainly vigorous."<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>An interesting little experiment was carried out by the
author in Glasgow, with the kind help of Professor Blyth, at
the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College. By
attaching one wire to the upper part of the stem of a young
pot-plant whilst the other wire was inserted in the base of
the stem, it was easy to show that an electric current was
passing&mdash;at any rate, during the daytime. In the evening,
however, this was not at all distinct. That such currents do
occur in living trees seems to be admitted. A similar current
was not found in a stick of dead-wood. The mere
passage of the water through the plant in transpiration
might, however, cause such a current, for the water is
evaporated at the leaves.</p>

<p>A strong electric shock may of course <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">electrocute</i> a plant
by killing the cells. It is possible to cause the Mimosa
leaves to close by means of an electric shock.</p>

and Grass-reeds&mdash;The richest lands in the world&mdash;Papyrus of Egypt&mdash;Birds
and hippopotami&mdash;Fever and ague.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HAT was the first green plant? When was the
surface of the earth first covered with flowers?
Such questions are quite impossible to answer. We
cannot even tell how plants ever came to exist on the earth
at all. Wonderful as are the stories of the hardihood of
bacteria, of spores, and of seeds, it is not possible to imagine
that they could have been whirled or drifted through infinite
space to this particular planet.</p>

<p>Yet it is at least probable that the first real plant on this
world was a seaweed or alga.</p>

<p>In Germany and Austria there are certain springs in which
the water coming from immense depths is at an exceedingly
high temperature. These hot springs are used as natural
hot baths, and have many interesting peculiarities. Amongst
others there is the fact that certain seaweeds or algæ are
found luxuriating in the hot water. Some of these can even
live in springs with a temperature of 176° F.!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Such algæ may have remained living in exceedingly hot
water ever since that long distant time, the very first of all
the geological periods, when there was no distinct separation
betwixt land and water, and when the waters which were
below the firmament had not been separated from those
which were above it. Then the world seems to have been
all fog and mist at a very high temperature.</p>

<p>But all theories on the origin of the world might be
briefly summarized by the last nine words!</p>

<p>At any rate, the first plant was almost certainly a seaweed
or alga not unlike those which produce the so-called
"breaking of the meres."</p>

<p>At some seasons the water of certain lakes, usually quite
clear and pure, becomes discoloured, turbid, and everywhere
crowded with multitudes of tiny, bright, verdigris-green
specks. The fish at once begin to sulk, refuse to take the
fly, and live torpid at the bottom of the water. The minute
green particles consist of a certain seaweed or alga. Mr.
Phillips put the head of a common pin in the water so as to
obtain a very small drop. When placed under a microscope,
this minute amount of water was found to contain
300 individual algæ.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This was in Newton Mere (Shropshire),
and as this lake extends over 115 acres, it is possible
to imagine the millions upon millions of algæ which must
have existed in it. The names of these seaweeds are many
thousand times longer than the algæ themselves, and it is
not really necessary to give them. One of them, however,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphanizomenon flos-aquæ</i>, has been noticed "tingeing with
its delicate green hue the margin of the smallest of the
Lochs Maben, in Dumfriesshire."<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Yet it is not so big as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the dot on the <i>i</i> in its name. Many other cases have
been recorded of lakes that were coloured sometimes a "pea-green,"
or even brown or red by similar tiny little seaweeds.
As we shall see, the water of such lakes generally contains a
very large amount of suspended or floating vegetable life.</p>

<p>Another curious appearance is <i>Gory Dew</i>. Patches of a
deep blood-red or purple colour are found on the ground or
on walls. They have just the appearance of recently-shed
blood. This also is due to an alga (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porphyridium cruentum</i>).
Dr. Cooke quotes from Drayton as follows: "In the plain,
near Hastings, where the Norman William, after his victory
found King Harold slain, he built Battle Abbey, which at
last, as divers other monasteries, grew to a town enough
populous. Thereabout is a place which, after rain, always
looks red, which some have attributed to a very bloody
sweat of the earth, as crying to Heaven for vengeance of so
great a slaughter."</p>

<p>The ordinary "Rain of Blood" which appears on <i>not too
fresh</i> meat, and looks like minute specks of red-currant
jelly, is due to one of the Bacteria (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Micrococcus prodigiosus</i>).</p>

<p>The original algæ or seaweeds probably had descendants
which migrated to the land and eventually after many
geological periods became our flowering plants and ferns.
But the earth has become so richly supplied with plants of
all sorts and kinds that it is now by no means easy for any
plant to find a roothold for its existence. So that a considerable
number have been forced back to the water, and
have accustomed themselves to live in or even under water
in company with their lowly cousins, the seaweeds, who
remained below its surface.</p>

<p>These water plants are very interesting. They are always
competing with one another. There is a perpetual struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
going on round every pond and loch, and by every river
side.</p>

<p>If you look carefully round the edge of a loch or pond
which lies in a grass field, certain series of plants are generally
found to follow one another in quite a definite way.
The first sign of water in grass is generally the presence of
moss or "fog" between the grass-stems and the appearance
of what farmers call the "Blue Carnation Grass." It is not
a grass but a sedge (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carex glauca</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. panicea</i>) with leaves
rather like those of a carnation. A little nearer the border
of the pond, there may be a tall coarse grass (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aira caespitosa</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Festuca elatior</i>). Next there is almost certain to
be a fringe of Rushes. Where the Rushes begin to find the
ground too wet for them, all sorts of marsh plants flourish,
such as Water Plantain, Cuckoo-flower, the Spearwort
Buttercup, Woundwort, and the like. As soon as the
actual water begins, one finds, whilst it is still shallow, the
Flag series of yellow or purple Irises, Bogbeans, Marsh
Cinquefoil, Mare's Tail, and Sedges of various kinds. In
this part the water ranges from an inch or two to about
eighteen inches deep.</p>

<p>The Flag or Iris is a very common and yet interesting
plant. It has a stout, fleshy stem lying flat on the mud,
and anchored to it by hundreds of little roots. The flower
is the original of the Fleur-de-lis, or Lily of France, which
took the fancy of the King of France as he rode through the
marshes towards Paris. (It is true that there are some unromantic
authors who hold that the emblem was really
intended to represent a frog or toad!)</p>

<p>The flower consists of three upright petals and three
hollow sepals, which make so many canals leading down to
the honey, and roofed over by an arched and coloured style.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
As the bee hurries down the canal to its nectar, its back is
first brushed by a narrow lip-like stigma and then dusted
with pollen. The leaves overlap in a curious way, and, when
they have withered, their stringy remains serve to protect
the fleshy stem. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orris root</i>, which is used in perfumery, is
the stem of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iris florentina</i>.</p>

<p>Most of the other plants in this Flag series will be found
to have prostrate main stems growing under the water, but
giving off flowering and foliage stems which stand up above
it, so that the leaves and flowers are above the surface.</p>

<p>In the next part of the pond, where the water is from
eighteen inches to nine feet deep, masses of reeds will be
found usually swaying, sighing, and whispering in the wind.
There are many kinds, such as Bulrushes, Phragmites,
Horsetail, Scirpus, etc. It seems to be the depth, the exposure
to wind, the character of the soil, and other unknown
factors, that determine which of those will be present. All
of them are tall, standing well above the water; their main
stem is usually flat on the bottom of the pond, or floating
horizontally in the water, but giving off many upright
branches.</p>

<p>Floating islands are often formed by some of these horizontal
main stems breaking off and being carried away.
Those Chinese who possess no land make floating islands of
such reeds for themselves, and grow crops on them. There
are hundreds of such islands in the Canton River.</p>

<p>Victoria Regia, the giant water-lily of the Amazons. Those shown are in a public park in
Minnesota and are able to support the weight of a child. In their native home the leaves are said
to be ten feet in diameter.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Beyond the reeds, one sees the large flat, floating leaves
and beautiful cup-like white or yellow flowers of the Water-lilies.
They grow in water which is not more than fifteen
feet deep. Their long stalks and leaf-stalks are flexible and
yield readily, so as to keep the flowers and leaves floating.
There are narrow submerged leaves as well. The actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
stem of the White Water-lily is about three inches in
diameter, and stout and fleshy. It is full of starchy material,
and lies upon the mud deep down at the bottom of the
pond. There are many advantages in the position of the
flowers, for bees, flies, and other useful insects can reach
them easily, but slugs, snails, and other enemies cannot do
so. The little seeds have a curious lifebelt-like cup, which
enables them to float on the surface.</p>

<p>Of course, our own British water-lilies cannot compare
with the magnificent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Victoria regia</i> of the tropics. Its
petals are white or pink on the inside, and its gigantic
leaves, six feet or more in diameter, can support a retriever
dog or a child. There used to be some of them at Kew
Gardens. A curious point about these enormous floating
leaves is that they are covered with little spiny points on the
under side and at the margin; that is probably to keep
some sort of fish from nibbling at the edges.</p>

<p>But to return to our pond. Beyond the water-lily region
and so long as the water is from twelve to twenty-four feet
deep, Pondweeds are able to grow, and their leaves may be
seen in the water, whilst their stalks stand up above the
surface so as to allow wind to scatter the pollen.</p>

<p>This depth of twenty-four feet seems at first sight very
great, but it is a mere nothing compared with the regions
entirely below the water, where certain Stoneworts (<i>Chara</i>)
and Mosses have been found flourishing. The former has
been dredged up from depths of ninety feet, and a little
moss was discovered in the Lake of Geneva growing quite
comfortably at a depth of 180 feet below the surface.</p>

<p>But it is quite impossible to appreciate the wonder and
beauty of the life in a pond unless by a strong effort of the
imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Suppose yourself to be a fish two or three inches long, and
accustomed to the dim, mysterious light which filters down
through the water from the sky above. Every here and
there great olive-brown leaf-stalks and stems cross and,
branching, intercept the light. Everything, the surface of the
mud, the stems and branches of the submerged water-plants,
is covered by an exquisite golden-brown powder, which
consists of hundreds and thousands of "Diatoms." Here
and there from the Pondweed and other stems hang festoons
or wreaths or threads of beautiful green Algæ. Little
branching sprays of them, or perhaps of the brown kind, are
attached here and there to the thick stems.</p>

<p>Even the very water is full of small, floating, vivid green
stars or crescents or three-cornered pieces which are free
floating Algæ or Desmids. Other diatoms are also free or
swim with a cork-screwing motion through the water. Great
snails and slugs crawl upon the plants, and weird large-eyed
creatures, with a superfluity of legs and an entire absence
of reserve as to what is going on inside their bodies, skirmish
around. So that such a pond is full of vegetable activity.
The free-swimming diatoms and desmids make up the food
of the snails and crustaceans. These latter in turn are the
food of fishes.</p>

<p>It is even possible to-day by carefully stocking an artificial
pond with water plants, by then introducing Mollusca and
Crustacea, and finally by the introduction of "eyed ova" or
fry of the trout, carp, or other fishes, to produce a regular
population of fishes which can be made more or less
profitable, and the process can be spoken of as "fish-farming."
Unfortunately there are a great many gaps in
our knowledge as to what fish actually feed on, and we know
even less about what the Mollusca and Crustacea require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
There is, however, a distinct annual harvest of these
minute seaweeds, of which different sorts appear to develop
one after the other, just as flowering plants do. The two
months January and February, which are almost without
flowers, are also those in which most of these minute
vegetables take their repose in the form of cysts or spores.</p>

<p>But these diatoms are too important and too interesting
to be dismissed in such a cursory manner. Each consists of
a tiny speck of living matter with a drop or two of oil enclosed
in a variously sculptured flinty shell. They have, in
fact, been compared to little protected cruisers which pass
to and fro in the water and multiply with the most extraordinary
rapidity.</p>

<p>If you (1) use dynamite to blast a rock, (2) if you
employ a microscope or telescope, (3) if you paint an oil
picture, (4) if you make a sound-proof partition in a set of
offices, the probability is that it has been necessary to use
the substance diatomite in each case. This consists of the
accumulated shells of myriads of diatoms.</p>

<p>Nor does that represent by any means the whole of the
usefulness of these tiny seaweeds. The oil shales, such as
occur in Linlithgowshire and elsewhere, are supposed to be
the muddy, oily deposits of such ponds as we have endeavoured
to describe. The oil found in the shales was
probably worked up by these diatoms in long-past geological
ages. It may be used to-day either (1) to drive motors,
(2) to light lamps, (3) to burn as so-called "wax" candles,
(4) to eat (as an inferior sort of chocolate cream).</p>

<p>Interesting as these diatoms are, it is not really possible to
understand their structure without the use of a microscope,
so that we must pass on to another side of the activity of
water plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Let us, for instance, notice some of the ordinary plants to
be found along a riverside. Willows and Alders are the
ordinary trees, because they are specially fitted to stand the
danger of being regularly overflowed. They easily take root,
so that branches broken off and floated down are enabled to
form new trees without much difficulty. In the United
States, it has become a custom to plant Willows along the
banks, because they are then not so liable to be broken
down and worn away. Yet when a big Willow tree has
become undermined, the weight of the trunk may cause it to
fall over towards the water, so that a large section of the
bank may be loosened and serious damage may be done if it
is torn away by a heavy flood.</p>

<p>Amongst such Willows, should be mentioned the "cricket
bat" kind, which has to be grown with the very greatest care,
and of which a single tree may be worth £28.</p>

<p>Many of our rivers are, alas, sadly polluted by artificial
and other impurities which kill the fishes and destroy the
natural vegetation. When this happens a horrible-looking
whitish fungus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apodytes lactea</i>) coats the stones and banks
under water and the water swarms with bacteria. This
fungus and the bacteria are really purifying the water, for
they break up the decaying matter in it.</p>

<p>The oily or slimy character of the outside skin of all submerged
plants is of very great importance to them. It allows
the water to glide or slip over them without any friction.</p>

<p>Still keeping to our river bank, let us look for submerged
plants. What is that dark green feathery plume? It is
the Hornwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceratophyllum</i>) gently wriggling or moving
from side to side. It has probably never been still for a
moment since it first began to grow. Take it out of the
water, and it collapses into a moist, unpleasant little body,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
but as soon as it is put in its natural element again it is
seen to have a thin flexible stem along which there are circles
of curved, finely divided leaves. Watch it in the water and
one is filled with astonishment at the perfection of the shape,
arrangement, and character of the leaves, which enables them
to hold their place even when a flood may cover them with
an extra twenty feet of water! The same sort of leaf,
but with great difference in detail, is found in the submerged
Water Crowfoot, Water Milfoil, Potamogetons, and others
which live under the same conditions.</p>

<p>If it were the St. John's River, we might see that extraordinary
Florida Hyacinth which has swollen, gouty-looking
leaf-stalks, and grows with such extraordinary rapidity that
it covers the whole surface of rivers, choking the paddle-wheels
of steamers and destroying the trade in timber, for no
logs can be floated down when it covers the water. Its
rosettes float on the surface, and are very interesting to
examine. If you upset one or turn it upside down in the
water, the "buoys" or swollen stalks act as a self-righting
arrangement, and it slowly returns to its proper position.</p>

<p>But in most rivers, one is certain to come across backwaters
where it is impossible to force a boat through on
account of the reeds and other marsh-plants.</p>

<p>There are places on the Danube where hundreds of square
miles are occupied by waving masses of the feathery-plumed
Phragmites, almost to the exclusion of any other sort of
vegetation. Giant specimens of it eighteen feet high have
been observed.</p>

<p>The same reed occurs in North and South America and
far up towards the Arctic regions. At first sight it seems
as if this was a mistake of Nature; why should so much of
the surface be occupied by this useless vegetable? But it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
necessary to say a little more about its habits and its
object in life.</p>

<p>The most interesting and curious point is the way in
which it grows in dense thickets; the main stem is really
horizontal and below the water, but it gives off a number of
upright stalks. Now every flood will carry in amongst the
stalks quantities of silt and rubbish. Those upright stems
will sift the water: all sorts of floating material, sand, silt,
dead leaves, fruit, etc., are left amongst them. So that such
a marsh or bed of Phragmites is gradually, flood by flood,
collecting the deposits of mud, and the bed becomes every
year more shallow. At the edge of the marsh there is
scarcely any water visible, and grasses and other plants are
beginning to grow between the Phragmites stems. Eventually
these latter are choked out, and a marshy alluvial flat
occupies the site of the old reed-bed.</p>

<p>So that the work of Phragmites is of the greatest possible
importance: it has to form those fertile alluvial flats which
are found along the course of every great river, and which
are by far the most valuable lands in the whole world.</p>

<p>Look, for instance, at the population of Belgium, Holland,
and Lower Germany, and notice how dense it is upon the
alluvial flats where the Meuse, Rhine, and other rivers
approach the sea. It is just the same in Britain. London
lies on the great alluvial flats of the Thames, Glasgow on
the Clyde, Liverpool on the Mersey. In China it is the
Yang-tze-kiang valley (especially near its mouth); in India,
the Ganges, of lower Bengal, and in the Argentine the La
Plata River, which show the greatest accumulations of
humanity. In every case it is the rich flat alluvium, which
is exceedingly fertile when drained and cultivated, that has
originally attracted so many people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Lower Egypt is the gift of the Nile, but it is not so
much the Nile as these neglected water plants which made
the rich lucerne, cotton, and food crops of Lower Egypt
possible. Amongst the Egyptian Reeds one especially is of
great importance. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papyrus antiquorum</i>, ten feet high,
has much the same habit as our Phragmites and other water
plants. It forms dense, almost impassable thickets, sometimes
completely occupying and choking a small valley, or
leaving only a passage, often changing and half choked,
through a larger one. This, with other plants, makes the
"sudd" of the Nile, which is one enormous accumulation of
marsh plants and reeds floating on the water and covering a
length of over 500 miles.</p>

<p>It was from the Papyrus that the ancient Egyptians made
their paper. The stems are six to seven inches in diameter.
"The pith of the larger flowering stems ... cut into
thin strips, united together by narrowly overlapping margins,
and then crossed under pressure by a similar arrangement
of strips at right angles, constitutes the Papyrus of
antiquity."</p>

<p>These great marshes and reed-beds are full of interest to
naturalists. The Fens of Lincolnshire and the Norfolk
Broads show the way in which water plants keep hold of the
worn and travelled rubbish of the hills, and prevent most of
it from becoming useless, barren sea-sands. These places,
however, like the sudd of the Nile, and the Roman "Campagna,"
have an evil reputation so far as climate is concerned.
This used to be the case even in lower Chelsea, in London
(where snipe were shot not so very long ago). It is as if
Nature had desired to do her own work in peace and without
being disturbed, for fever, ague, mosquitoes, and malaria are
very common. Yet a certain number of people always live in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
such places. In France, e.g., the leeches in the great marshes
near the Landes form a source of riches. Such reeds also are
or were the home of the hippopotamus, crocodile, and other
extraordinary animals. The extinct British hippopotamus
no doubt found in the Chelsea or other marshes a home as
congenial to its tastes as is the sudd of Egypt to its living
descendants or allies. In other places the enormous quantities
of water birds, myriads of ducks, geese, swans, regiments
of flamingoes, snipe, and the like, have called into existence
peculiar kinds of industry in fowling and netting that are
not without importance. The decoys in the Fens yield
hundreds of birds for the London market, and the duck-punts
with their huge guns also bring in quantities of wild
fowl.</p>

<p>But all this industry is very trifling compared with that
of Phragmites and its associates, who have strained from the
water of the Thames most of the ground on which London
now stands.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HERE should one seek for peace on earth? The
ideal chosen for one well-known picture is a grassy
down "close clipt by nibbling sheep," such as the
fresh green turf of the South Downs.</p>

<p>Others might prefer the "Constable country," near perhaps
the famous "Valley Farm" of which the picture now
hangs in the National Gallery, and especially in early spring.
At any rate, once seen, one remembers for ever afterwards
those glossy-coated, well-fed, leisurely cows grazing hock-deep
in rich meadows full of bright flowers and graceful grasses,
through which there winds a very lazy river bordered by
trim pollarded willows.</p>

<p>The charm of the South Downs and of Constable's
meadows depends upon their peaceful quiet, and the absence
of any sign of the handiwork of disturbing man.</p>

<p>But such meadows are entirely artificial. They could no
more exist in nature than a coal-mine, if it were not for man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
help. Moreover, they are in a state of perpetual war! No
plant within them experiences the blessings of peace from the
time it germinates until the day that it dies.</p>

<p>Each plant is fighting with its neighbours for light, for
air, for water, and for salts in the soil, and it is also trying
to protect itself against grazing animals, against the vole
which gnaws its roots, and against the insects and caterpillars
which try to devour its buds.</p>

<p>Besides its own private and individual troubles, it is but
one of a whole company or army of plants which, like a cooperative
society, occupy the field.</p>

<p>Other societies, such as peat-moss, thickets, and woods, try
to drive out the grasses and cover that particular place in its
stead. The Grassland companions are also always trying to
take up new ground, and to cover over any which is not
strongly held by other plants.</p>

<p>A road, for instance, is always being attacked by the
grassland near it. It is sure to have a distinct border of Rat's
Tail Plantain, Dandelion, Creeping Buttercup, and Yellow
Clovers. These are the advanced guard of the grassland.
However heavily you tread upon these plants, you will do
them no injury whatever, for they are specially designed to
resist heavy weights. But, if the road were only left alone,
these bordering plants would be very soon choked out. The
ordinary buttercup would replace the creeping species, and
white or red clovers take the place of the little yellow ones,
whilst grasses would very soon spring up all over it.</p>

<p>But of course the roadman comes and scrapes off all the
new growth of colonizing grasses, etc. Then the plantains,
dandelions, and yellow clovers patiently begin their work
again.</p>

<p>These sequoias grow to from 250 to 400 feet high, though they are not quite the
tallest trees in the world.</p>
<p>(See page <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Switzerland, in those valleys in which the glaciers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
melting away, leaving stretches of bare mud, scratched stones,
and polished rock, plants immediately begin to settle there.
A Swiss botanist watched the process during five or six years,
and describes how first the yellow Saxifrage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. aizoides</i>)
establishes itself. Next season Coltsfoot, willow-herb, Oxyria,
and two grasses had planted themselves. During the third
season another grass came in. By the fourth season, Fescues
and yarrow had appeared, and by the fifth season, five
grasses, clovers, and yarrow had formed a regular grassland
upon the new untouched soil.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>In such cases, Nature, who abhors bare ground, is
endeavouring to clothe it with useful vegetation.</p>

<p>The fights which are going on are of the most ruthless
character. Many weeds are said to produce some 30,000
seeds in one year, and every plant which grows in a meadow
is scattering thousands of seeds. But of course the number
of plants remains much the same, so that 29,999 seeds are
wasted (or the seedlings choked out) for every one that
grows up!</p>

<p>It is probably because of this perpetual warfare that the
growth of the grasses is so vigorous, and their whole structure
so perfectly adapted. If you watch a flowering grass,
you are sure to notice how narrow is its stem compared with
the height. A factory chimney only fifty-eight feet high
requires to be at least four feet broad at the base, yet a ryeplant
1500 millimetres high may be only three millimetres
broad near the root. Man's handiwork, the chimney, is in
height seventeen times its diameter, but the height of the
grass is 500 times its diameter.</p>

<p>The neatness of design, the graceful curves and perfect
balance in the little flowering branches at the top of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
haulm, is always worth looking at, and particularly in the
early morning when it is beset with sparkling drops of dew.</p>

<p>It is all wiry, bending and swaying to the wind so as to
produce those waves which roll across a hay-field, and on
which the shimmering light is reflected and changes colour.
The fight for light and air, the struggle to get their heads
up above their competitors, produces all this exquisite
mechanism.</p>

<p>It is true that a heavy rainstorm may beat the stems flat
down to the ground, but, as soon as the weather becomes dry
again these same stems will raise themselves up and become
upright; they have a special sensitiveness and a special
kind of growth which enables them to do this.</p>

<p>There are two special dangers which all such artificial
meadows have to withstand. Let us see what will happen if
such a meadow begins to dry up through a sinking of the
level of the water below the soil.</p>

<p>Each grass has its own special favourite amount of moisture.
It likes to have its water at just one particular depth
below the surface. Unfortunately there are not nearly
enough sympathetic and careful observations of the preferences
of each individual grass. A Danish author has
worked out the facts in certain localities (Geest). Suppose
first that the water-level of the wells, etc., is 6-1/2 to 9-3/4 feet
below the surface. This suits the Meadow Poa grass (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poa
pratensis</i>) exactly. It will grow luxuriantly and flourish.
Now suppose the weather is very wet, so that the water rises
in the wells till they are three to four feet deep. The
Roughish Poa (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. trivialis</i>) prefers this moister soil, and it
will grow so vigorously that it will kill out the other kind.
If it is a season of very heavy floods, or if the drains become
choked so that the water rises to within fourteen to twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
inches of the surface, then the tufted Aira (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deschampsia
caespitosa</i>) will kill out the other kinds and flourish abundantly.
But if the water rises higher than this the marsh
series comes in (see Chap. <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>).</p>

<p>So that the thirsty grasses of the meadow are helped or
hindered in their fight for life by changes in the water away
down in the soil below their roots.</p>

<p>Even in Great Britain one can see distinct differences in
very dry and very wet summers, but all these pastures,
meadowlands, and hay-fields are, as we have already mentioned,
as much due to man's forethought and industry as a
factory or coal-mine.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to realize this. The best way is to go
to the National, or any other good picture-gallery, and look
carefully at any landscapes painted before the year 1805.
You will scarcely believe that the country as painted can be
the land we know. Where is the "awful orderliness" of
England? Where are the trim hedges? Where are the
tidy roadsides and beautifully embanked rivers that we
see to-day?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, until the great Macadam made good
roads and the great Telford and other engineers built stone
bridges, it was impossible to rely on getting about with
carts and carriages. Gentlemen's coaches and wagons used
to be literally stuck in the mud! Horses were drowned at
fords, or died in their struggles to pull very light loads
through mud which nearly reached the axles of the wheels
(see Chap. <span class="smcap">XI.</span>).</p>

<p>Besides the change due to roads, fences, drains, and farm
buildings, the very grasses themselves are growing unnaturally.
The farmer has selected and sown what he
thinks best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
He is obliged to do so, because grasses vary so much.
Some of them shoot up quickly and die after the first year.
Others live for two years, whilst a great many bide their
time, developing very slowly, and not reaching their full
growth until the fourth or fifth year.</p>

<p>Some are tall and vigorous, others are short; some flower
early in the season, and others very late. Many send out
quantities of suckers or runners at the base, so that they
form a dense, intricate turf&mdash;a mass of stems and roots
thickly covering the ground.</p>

<p>A farmer wants his pasture to begin early and to continue
late; he must have a good first year's crop, and it must remain
good for years afterwards. So that his calculations as
regards the proportions of the different grass seeds which he
requires are of the most abstruse character.</p>

<p>To sow such "permanent pasture," prepared by blending
together grasses and clovers with an eye to all the above
necessities, there will be needed some seven million seeds for
every acre.</p>

<p>The art consists in coaxing the good, lasting, nutritious
ones to make both tall hay, rich aftermath, and a close,
thick turf below, and, until these are ready, to use the
annual and biennial grasses.</p>

<p>Such beautifully shaven, green, soft turf as one sees in the
lawns of cathedrals or the "quads" at Oxford and Cambridge
has been most carefully and regularly watered, rolled,
and mown for hundreds of years. It is not easy to keep
even a tennis-lawn in good condition. Little tufts of
daisies appear. Their leaves lie so flat that they escape the
teeth of the mower, and they are not so liable to be injured
by tennis-shoes as the tiny upright grass-shoots which are
trying to spring up everywhere. The Plantain is even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
worse, for it is specially built to stand heavy weights, and
it has several roots which divide and branch like the prongs
which fix teeth in the jaw, so that it is very difficult to
howk it out.</p>

<p>Thus our grasslands in Britain are unnatural and
artificial productions. If the field drains are choked, moss
or fog and rushes appear. Still more interesting, however,
is what happens if the farmer is not careful to destroy the
taller weeds, such as Dock, Ragweed, Cow Parsnip, Thistles,
and the like. If you walk over a grass-field in early spring,
you are sure to see some of these pests. At this stage they
have a very humble, weak, and innocent appearance: they
are quite small rosettes or tufts. Yet they are crowded
with leaves, which are hard at work busily manufacturing
food material. Soon they begin to shoot up. Their leaves
overreach all the neighbouring grasses. Their roots spread
in every direction, taking what ought to go to the "good
green herb intended for the service of man." They finally
accomplish their wickedness by producing thousands of
seeds, which are scattered broadcast over the fields.</p>

<p>By this time the farmer sees what is going on, and endeavours
to cut them down; but it is a long, slow, and
laborious proceeding. One year's seeding means seven years'
weeding.</p>

<p>Yet these tall Thistles and Ragweeds are only the first
stage of a very interesting invasion. Look around the field
corners, on railway-banks, or in old quarries, where man has
left things alone. You will see these same tall herbs (the
Ragweed, etc.), but you are sure to find a place where they
are being suppressed by Rasps, Briers, and Brambles.
These are taller, stronger, and more vigorous than the
herbs, and they also last longer, for their leaves are still at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
work in November. This is the second stage of the invasion.
But if the place has been long neglected, Hawthorns and
Rowans, Birch and Ash will be found growing up. These
last show what is happening.</p>

<p>A wood is trying to grow up on the grassland. If left
alone, an oak or beech forest would, after many years, spread
over all our grass pastures and hay-fields. These tall herbs
are the pioneers, and the briers and brambles are its
advanced guard.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, by far the greatest part of our
agricultural land <em>was</em> a forest, but it has been cut down,
drained, dug, weeded, hedged, and "huzzed and maazed"
with agricultural implements and more or less scientifically
selected manures, until it is made to yield good beef, excellent
mutton, and almost the largest crops per acre in the
world.</p>

<p>Natural grasslands exist, however, in every continent.</p>

<p>The great Steppes of Southern Russia and the pastures
that extend far to the eastward even to the very borders of
China, the Prairies of North America, the Pampas of
Argentina, the great sheep-farms of Australia, and a large
proportion of South Africa, consist of wide, treeless, grassy
plains, where forests only occur along the banks of rivers, in
narrow hill-valleys, or upon mountains of considerable altitude.
Upon these great plateaux or undulating hills the
rainfall, though it is but small in amount, is equally distributed,
so that there is no lengthy and arid dry season.
Take the American Prairie, for instance. These valuable
lands, once the home of unnumbered bison and hordes of
antelopes, lie between the ancient forests of the eastern
states and the half-deserts and true salt deserts of the
extreme west. Rivers, accompanied in their windings by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
riverside forests, are found (especially in the east). The
real prairie has a blackish, loamy soil, covered sometimes by
the rich Buffalo or Mesquite grass, which forms a short,
velvety covering, not exactly a turf such as we find in England,
but still true grassland. It is only green in early
spring.</p>

<p>The Bushman is levering up the root of elephant's foot to get the starchy food
inside. He does it by a stick run through a rounded stone. The woman has caught
a lizard for the boy to eat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the spring onwards until the end of summer there
is an endless succession of flowers. The first spring blossoms
appear in April; great stretches are covered with Pentstemons,
Cypripediums, and many others in May and June; then
follow tall, herbaceous Phloxes, Lilies, and Asclepiads, but
perhaps the most characteristic flora blossoms still later on,
when every one "wants to be in Kansas when the Sunflowers
bloom." Over these prairies used to travel the great wagons
or "prairie schooners." The cowboy, who almost lives on
horseback, watches over great herds of cattle and troops
of half-wild horses. Yet his life is, or used to be, almost as
free, comfortless, and uncivilized as that of the buffalo-hunting
Indian who preceded him. One must not forget to
mention the prairie-dog&mdash;able to utilize the abundant grass,
and diving into a safe refuge underground when threatened
by the wolves or other carnivorous creatures, which, of
course, multiplied exceedingly, thanks to the jack-hare, antelopes,
and bisons.</p>

<p>The Pampas in South America is a similar grassland. On
the east it stops at the woodlands along the great Plate
River, but on the west it becomes gradually more dry and
arid, until long before the Andes are reached it is too dry
even to carry sheep, and can only be described as a half-desert.</p>

<p>"It is a boundless sea of grasses fading into the distant
horizon, which can only be distinguished when the sun is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
rising or setting." Yet amongst the grasses are hundreds of
flowers, and, a fact which is very remarkable, many of them,
such as Fennel, Artichoke, Milk Thistle, Burdock, Rye Grass,
etc., are European plants which have dispossessed the natives
over miles of country, exactly as the gaucho has driven away
or exterminated the Indians who lived there. It is covered
by tufts of grass betwixt which appears the rich alluvial
earth, yet in good years it may become almost a perfect
grass floor. "The colour changes greatly, for in spring
when the old grass is burnt off, it is coal-black, which
changes to a bright blue-green as soon as the young leaves
appear; later on it becomes brownish green, which again
changes when the silver-white flowers come out to the
appearance of a rolling, waving sea of shining silver."</p>

<p>Here would be the place to mention how an army encamped
upon the Pampas finds itself next morning imprisoned
and doomed to perish miserably in a forest of giant
thistles which has sprung up during the night. There is no
doubt that thistles and other weeds are very tall in both
South and North America. Fennels are ten to twelve feet
high, and even little Chenopodiums (such as in England may
reach eighteen inches), become in South America seven to
eight feet high, but the tallness of some of the stories is
more remarkable even than that of the plants!</p>

<p>Over the Pampas used to roam thousands of guanacos (a
creature of the most unlovely type, which resembles both a
camel, a mule, a deer, and a horse); here also were Darwin's
ostriches (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhea Darwinii</i>) and other game, which were
caught by the lasso and by the peculiar "bolas" of the
Indians. They used to surround the herds and then massacre
them by hundreds. The "tuco tuco" also, which is a
burrowing rodent with habits very like those of the prairie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
dog, finds plenty of sustenance in the abundant grasses.
Upon them subsist pumas, foxes, and other carnivores.</p>

<p>We have said that the Pampas gradually changes from
being very fertile on the east to being almost a desert on the
west. Here is the place to mention a very interesting, if not
romantic, fact. The guanaco does <em>not</em> travel hundreds of
miles in order to die in one particular spot as soon as it feels
ill, but it does resort especially to certain spots. There the
grass is often a bright, fresh green, for it is plentifully
manured, and consequently the guanaco helps to encourage
the good grasses to occupy a half-desert. On the eastern
side of the Pampas great changes are beginning to appear.
The owners of the great camps, haciendas or cattle-ranches
let off small parts of their land to Italian "colonists."
These people grow crops of Indian corn, and when that has
been reaped, the valuable Alfalfa or Lucerne is sown down.
This forms the most exquisite and valuable pasture, and
consequently far more Shorthorn and Durham cattle can be
maintained.</p>

<p>There are in South Africa enormous grassy plains, where
once springbok and other game used to exist in enormous
herds (Wangeman records having seen a herd of antelope
four miles long), in spite of lions and other beasts of
prey, and in spite also of the Boer, who was as much a
horseman as the gaucho or Red Indian. The great buck
wagons of South Africa were almost as much the real
homes of the Boers as the two-roomed huts which make up
his "farms."</p>

<p>The great Steppes of Russia and Siberia are also grasslands.
"As seen from a distance hills covered by the Stipa
grass resemble sand-hills, but, when nearer at hand, the sand-grey
colour changes into a silvery white, and these ever-moving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
grasses remind one of the waves of the ocean and, in spite
of their monotony, leave a pleasant impression."<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Tulips, Hyacinths, Veronicas, Periwinkles, Scotch Thistles,
Euphorbias, Wormwoods, and other of our common plants
or their near cousins, make up most of the flora of the
Steppes. Yet there are hundreds of others, for it is a
vegetation very rich in species.</p>

<p>If one reads in Gibbon's stately language of the mode of
life of the Huns, the Scythians, and those other barbarians
who, originating in these huge grasslands, occasionally
overflowed and overwhelmed the civilization of declining
Rome, the resemblance to Red Indians, Pampas Indians,
cowboys, gauchos, and Boers is not a little striking.</p>

<p>Read, for instance, the magnificent account of the great
hunting matches of the Tartar princes. "A circle is drawn
of many miles in circumference, to encompass the game of an
extensive district; and the troops that form the circle
regularly advance towards a common centre, where the
animals, surrounded on every side, are abandoned to the
darts of the hunters." Both the Red Indians of the Prairie
and the savages of the Pampas used to surround and destroy
the game in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Chinese princess given over for political
advantages to a prince of the Huns, "laments that she had
been condemned by her parents to a distant exile, under a
barbarian husband, and complains that sour milk was her
only drink, raw flesh her only food, a tent her only palace."
This describes exactly the ordinary life and home of the
Huns. "The Scythians of every age have been celebrated
as bold and skilful riders; and constant practice had seated
them so firmly on horseback, that they were supposed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life&mdash;to eat,
to drink, and even to sleep&mdash;without dismounting from their
steeds." Red Indians of Pampas and Prairie, cowboy and
gaucho, lived exactly in the same way.</p>

<p>In those pages of Gibbon which treat of the Huns, Scythians,
and other hordes, one recognizes sometimes the
wagon of the Boers; sometimes a migration of the East
African Masai; then perhaps it is a weapon that is really
the lasso, or a disposition and character exactly paralleled by
the Crows and Blackfeet. Even the great grass plains of
Australia, where the kangaroo, the wallaby, and the dingo
have been replaced by the sheep and the "Waler" horse,
one finds, in the shepherd and squatter, traits that remind
one of the gaucho or the cowboy.</p>

<p>Nor is this in the least extraordinary, for when a scanty
rainfall produces those great limitless rolling seas of grass,
Nature provides first large herbivorous animals to eat it
down as well as carnivorous beasts to keep their numbers in
control, until such time as a race of horsemen appears,
whose domestic cattle replace the bisons, guanacos, kangaroos,
and antelopes, and so assist in replenishing and
subduing the earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="small">POISONS</span></h2>

<p class="hanging">Poisoned arrows&mdash;Fish poisons&mdash;Manchineel&mdash;Curare&mdash;A wonderful
story&mdash;Antiaris&mdash;Ordeals&mdash;The Obi poison&mdash;Oracles produced by
poisons&mdash;Plants which make horses crazy and others that remove
their hair&mdash;Australian sheep and the Caustic Creeper&mdash;Swelled head&mdash;Madness
by the Darling Pea&mdash;Wild and tame animals, how they
know poisons&mdash;How do they tell one another?&mdash;The Yew tree, when is
it, and when is it not poisonous?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VEN to-day all embryo chemists and doctors are
required to "pass" in the recognition of the more
important medicinal plants.</p>

<p>But their knowledge is probably very superficial as compared
with that of a bushman in the Kalahari Desert of
South Africa. Every man, woman, and child in such a tribe
knows thoroughly every plant that grows in the neighbourhood.
His diet is a varied one, for it includes maggots,
fish, frogs, snakes, white ants, and other horrible ingredients,
but he lives mainly on roots, bulbs, and herbs of sorts.
In times of famine he has had to obtain the most intimate
knowledge possible of many plants, that namely which is
obtained by eating them, and he has most carefully observed
the poisonous kinds. These latter have given him, too, a
very powerful weapon, for it is the poisoned arrows which
give him the chance of killing game, otherwise utterly
beyond his reach. He is on the fair road to becoming a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
hunter and tribesman, instead of being only a member of a
morose, outcast family, always wandering and always hungry.</p>

<p>Probably poisons were first used in fishing. Many vegetable
drugs, when thrown into pools and lakes, have the
property of stupefying or killing the fish. A great many of
these fish poisons are known, and it is quite easy to use
them.</p>

<p>Amongst the Dyaks of Borneo, screens of basketwork
are placed along a stream to prevent the fish escaping.
Then the Dyaks collect along either bank in their canoes.
Everybody has a supply of the root of the tubai (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Menispermum
sp.</i>), which they hammer with stones in the water
inside the canoe, so as to extract the poison. At a given
signal the poisonous stuff is baled into the river, and very
soon afterwards a scene of wild excitement begins, for the fish
are speared or captured with handnets as they rise, stupefied,
to the surface. The women scoop up the small fry in their
nets.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Even at the Sea of Galilee, Tristram mentions that Arabs
sometimes obtain their fish by poisoned bread-crumbs. In
the South Sea Islands, at Tahiti, a poison is obtained from
the nuts of a kind of Betonica, and is used to catch the fish
among the reefs near shore.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In West Africa several fish poisons
are in use (e.g. seeds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tephrosia Vogelii</i>), and probably
the same methods are used almost everywhere. They are
by no means extinct even at home, for the occasional poacher
sometimes uses fish poisons.</p>

<p>Arrow poison is, however, much more important, and is
used by a great number of tribes in almost every part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
world. In 1859, in a war with the Dyaks of Borneo, the
English army lost thirty men by poisoned arrows. They are
deadly weapons, for the dart is a very thin piece of reed or
cane, which has been dipped in the Upas poison (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiaris
toxicaria</i>). It is propelled from a blow pipe, which in
practised hands is able to carry 250 feet. One or two of these
darts may cause death in two hours' time. The Spaniards,
in their conquest of the West Indian islands, were often defeated
by the poisoned arrows of the Caribs. The wounded
died in agonies of suffering and delirium, sometimes protracted
for twenty-four hours after receiving the wound.</p>

<p>The poison in this case is supposed to have been the
Manchineel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippomane</i>).</p>

<p>It is a handsome tree, but a very dangerous one, for
the slightest cut on the surface produces a flow of a
very fine white milk which is acrid and poisonous. This
juice produces temporary or total blindness if the slightest
speck enters the eyes, or even if one sits over a fire
made of its wood. It is probably not true that people are
killed if they merely sleep below it, and grass will probably
grow quite well under its shade, although there are stories
which deny this. Blowpipes and poisoned darts are used
by many savages in Asia and South America. Perhaps the
Curare or Woorali poison is the most wonderful of the South
American kinds. The tree, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strychnos sp.</i>, grows along the
Amazon and in the Guianas. The poison is obtained from
the wood and bark, and several other vegetable substances
are mixed with it. (This is a very common feature of native
drugs and increases the chances of doing <em>something</em>.) It is a
blood poison, and a very deadly one. Large animals like the
tapir stagger about, collapse, and die after a very few steps,
if they have been wounded by a dart. Humboldt declares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
that the earth-eating Otomaks were able to kill their
antagonists by the mere pressure of their poisoned thumbnails.</p>

<p>In Africa it is more usual to find poisoned arrows shot
from a bow. The exquisitely beautiful seed of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strophanthus
Kombe</i> is used as an arrow poison. The plant is a climber
found in forests or bush, and has large woody pods about
seven to twelve inches long. When these are open, the
inside is seen to be full of the small yellowish seeds;
each ends in a fine awn three to four inches long, which
carries at the end a beautiful tuft of the finest silky
hairs. The seed-coat is also covered with silk hairs. When
viewed against a black surface, there is no more lovely object
in nature. Yet from the seed-coat a very deadly poison is
obtained; probably snake-venom and various gluey substances
form part of the mixture, which is daubed on the
arrows. Dr. Kolbe saw the Hottentots plastering their
arrows with the poison of the hooded snake. Bushmen use a
Lily bulb, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haemanthus toxicarius</i>, but sometimes add part of
the inside of a small caterpillar.</p>

<p>Another African poison which is not so well known is the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acokanthera</i>, which was the ingredient in the arrows obtained
by the writer in British East Africa.</p>

<p>North America is singularly free from these unsportsmanlike
and horrible weapons, but they were not unknown in
Europe in very ancient times. Pliny speaks of the Arabian
pirates as poisoners, and allusions to their use of deadly
arrows can be found in Horace, Ovid, and Homer. In the
<i>Odyssey</i>, the hero goes to Ephyra (Epirus?) to purchase a
deadly arrow poison, but he is refused for fear of the eternal
gods. Poisoned arrows were employed by the Celts in Gaul,
and also by the Saracens in the War of Granada in 1484.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Yet even in the time of Homer the sense of humanity
seems to have decided against poisoned arrows as being both
unnecessary and cruel, just as, in our own times, explosive
bullets have been condemned, and are no longer used by
civilized nations. But we should remember that until man
became so expert with the bow and spear and so civilized by
tribal fights as to be able to do without poisons, they were a
very useful help in the struggle for civilization. Hundreds
of thin pieces of bamboo about six inches long were
regularly carried by certain African tribes. When dipped
in poison and afterwards placed in paths in the ground,
they formed a very efficient protection against barefooted
enemies.</p>

<p>The Antiaris alluded to above is the famous Upas tree of
Java. The tree was <em>said</em> to grow in a desert with not
another living plant within ten miles of it. Such was the
virulence of its poison that there were no fish in the waters.
Neither rat, nor mouse, nor any other vermin had ever been
seen there; and when any birds flew so near this tree that
the effluvia reached them, they fell dead&mdash;a sacrifice to the
effects of its poison. Out of a population of sixteen
hundred persons who were compelled, on account of civil
dissensions, to reside within twelve or fourteen miles of the
tree, not more than three hundred remained alive in two
months. Criminals condemned to die were offered the chance
of life if they would go to the Upas tree and collect some of
the poison. They were provided with masks (not unlike
our modern motor-veils), and yet not two in twenty returned
from the expedition.</p>

<p>All the foregoing statements were for years implicitly
believed. They were vouched for by a Dutch surgeon resident
in Java. Medicine is a profession, and Holland is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
country which would in no way lead one to expect such
magnificent mendacious audacity!</p>

<p>For the whole of the preceding statements about Antiaris
is pure romance. The inner bark of young trees, when made
into coarse garments, produces an extremely painful itching,
whilst the dried juice is a virulent arrow poison.</p>

<p>Hellebore and Aconite were the favourite poisons of the
Marquise de Brinvilliers and other specialists of the Middle
Ages. The Christmas Roses or Hellebores were known to
be poisonous fourteen hundred years before the Christian
era, and are still used in medicine. Aconite, which has
a tuberous root-stock, is dangerous, for it is occasionally
eaten in mistake for the horse-radish, to which it has a faint
resemblance. All kinds of aconite are poisonous. That of
one of the Indian species is used to tip the arrows employed
in shooting tigers.</p>

<p>Trials by ordeal were very common in ancient times. The
theory was that an innocent person was not injured by
certain drugs, which, however, proved immediately fatal to
the guilty.</p>

<p>Such trials at one time were customary in almost every
part of the world. They were supposed to be perfectly just,
so that no man could be held guilty of the death of those
who succumbed. In practice, however, they were almost
invariably corrupt. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanghinia venenifera</i> of Madagascar
was regularly used in ordeals, and is probably still
employed by certain tribes. The seeds are exceedingly
poisonous, but, if the authorities wish the accused person
to escape, a strong emetic is mixed with the powdered seeds,
and the poison has no time to act. This, however, is seldom
the case, for in any savage nation no one who is popular
and in good esteem with the king or other people in authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
is at all likely to be accused. The fact of his being accused
means in most cases that he is already condemned to die.
Another ordeal plant is the Calabar Bean (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Physostigma
venenosa</i>), found in West Africa. The plant is a climber
belonging to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminosæ</i>, and the seeds, which are
about an inch in diameter, are very deadly. The seed is conspicuously
marked by the long, dark, sunken scar, where it
was attached to the pod. Besides being exceedingly
poisonous, it has also a curious effect upon the pupil of
the eye, which is contracted by this drug.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Another famous poison is produced from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Datura stramonium</i>
and allied species. In tropical and sub-tropical
countries, one is almost sure to find specimens of this handsome
plant along almost every roadside. It is in fact one
of the commonest tropical weeds. The leaves are large with
fine spinose margins, and the flower is most conspicuous, as it
is four or five inches long. This is supposed to be one of the
drugs employed by the Obi wizards and witches. The most
horrible rites, accompanied by atrocious cruelties, were performed
amongst certain West African tribes and are continued
amongst their descendants, the freed slaves of the
West Indies and of the Southern United States.</p>

<p>Even to-day no white man is allowed to learn anything
of the proceedings, but some form of devil-worship or
Shamanism, accompanied by incantations and the use of
poisonous drugs, still flourishes. Preparations of various
sorts of Datura or Thorn-apple produce sometimes stupefaction,
sometimes frantic, furious delirium, and sometimes
death.</p>

<p>It is used in medicine as a narcotic and diuretic. Burton
says that the Arabs smoke the leaves in pipes as a cure for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
influenza and asthma. It is sometimes used in Europe for
neuralgia and even epilepsy. On the other hand, the priests
of the ancient Peruvians used Datura to produce the ravings
mistaken for inspiration, and it is supposed that the
priests of Apollo at Delphi employed an allied species for the
same purpose. In India, China, West Africa, and amongst
the American blacks, it is still very commonly used.</p>

<p>A firm belief existed in the Middle Ages that every plant
was a good remedy for something. There is a real basis in
fact for this superstition, because every plant in the world
has, so far as it can do so, to protect itself. The attacks of
all sorts of grazing animals, from the mouse to the elephant,
as well as the infinitely more dangerous and destructive
insects, bacteria, and fungi, have to be provided for. By far
the commonest form of protection is to develop within the
plant strong medicinal or strongly smelling substances.
These are far better as protective agents than the thorns
and spines characteristic of deserts and half-deserts. We
have already glanced at the turpentines and resins of
Coniferous forests and at the odorous gums, frankincense, and
myrrh of the Acacia scrub.</p>

<p>The use of poisons as protection is eminently characteristic
of three of the natural orders. The Buttercups (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ranunculaceæ</i>),
the Potato order (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solanaceæ</i>) and the Lilies. Of
the first named, the celery-leaved, and indeed all Buttercups,
are extremely poisonous; so also are all Aconites and
Hellebores, as well as Marsh Marigold, Adonis, Clematis,
and Larkspur.</p>

<p>Others, though not poisonous, are strongly medicinal, such
as Blake Snakeroot, Hydrastis, etc. It is therefore inadvisable
to use any of this order for food unless other people
have eaten it without any inconvenience!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
The beauty of the Lily order does not prevent it from
being a particularly dangerous group of plants. Perhaps
the worst poisons in this order are those of the Meadow
Saffron (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colchicum autumnale</i>), Herb Paris, Veratrum, Sabadilla,
Lily of the Valley, Tulip, and Crown Imperial bulbs.
Chamælirium, Trillium, Squills, Garlic, Solomon's Seal,
Aloes, and the Sarsaparillas are all well-known medicines.</p>

<p>The order <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solanaceæ</i> is perhaps the most interesting, for it
includes such dangerous poisons as Tobacco, Datura, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atropa
belladonna</i> (Deadly Nightshade), Henbane, Bittersweet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solanum
dulcamara</i>), Common Nightshade (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solanum nigrum</i>),
and a very great many important drugs. Even the common
potato contains a poisonous secretion <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solanin</i>, and it is
dangerous to eat green potatoes or the foliage. Yet the
Tomato or Love Apple (so called because it was supposed
to excite tender feelings) is both nutritious and delicious.
Chillies and Cayenne Pepper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capsicum spp.</i>) are also commonly
used as condiments.</p>

<p>Such poisonous orders should of course be avoided, but
much more dangerous are those deadly plants which appear
as it were accidentally in orders which are amongst the most
useful friends of man. Amongst the grasses there is the
deadly Darnel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lolium temulentum</i>), a first cousin and not
very unlike the very commonest and one of the most useful
grasses&mdash;Rye Grass (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lolium perenne</i>).</p>

<p>Then in the useful Carrot order, there are such dangerous
and even deadly plants as Fool's Parsley, Water Dropwort,
and Cowbane. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">&OElig;nanthe crocata</i> (Water Dropwort) is one of
the very commonest marsh and ditch plants in Great
Britain. It is perfectly well known to botanists as distinctly
poisonous, yet in 1902 a veterinary surgeon brought me
some of the tuberous roots to name, and told me that six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
fine young cows were lying dead on a neighbouring farm
through having eaten them!</p>

<p>A particularly useful order of plants (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminosæ</i>), the
Beans and Peas, contains a few poisonous species. It is said
that in every year children are sure to be killed by eating
the seeds of the Laburnum, and to this order belong also
the Calabar Bean and Crab's Eyes. The last named is only
fatal when introduced below the skin in small quantities.
The seeds of the Bitter Vetch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lathyrus sativus</i>) produce
paralysis of the legs in man and also in horses. The Crazy
or Loco weed of North America is sometimes eaten by horses
in the Western United States. The wretched animals
stagger about as if intoxicated, and eventually die. Belonging
to this same order is the Wild Tamarind, or Jumbai,
of Jamaica (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucæna glauca</i>). It is a weedy-looking acacia,
and extremely common in all tropical countries. Dr. D. Morris
thus alludes to it:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>"Mr. Robert Russell, of St. Ann's, informs me that horses
feeding on the leaves of this plant completely lose the hair
from their manes and tails. This ... statement was supported
by the testimony of so many people acquainted with
the facts that there was no reason to doubt it. Many years
afterwards (in December, 1895), I renewed my acquaintance
with the plant in the Bahamas. The plant was much more
plentiful there than in Jamaica; it was, in fact, distinctly
encouraged in the former islands as a fodder plant. The
people were fully aware of the singular effect it produced on
horses, and added that it also affected mules and donkeys.
Its effect on pigs was still more marked. These animals
assumed a completely naked condition, and appeared without
a single hair on their body. Horses badly affected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Jumbai were occasionally seen in the streets of Nassau,
where they were known as 'cigar-tails.' Such depilated
animals, although apparently healthy, were considerably
depreciated in value. They were said to recover when fed
exclusively on corn and grass. The new hair was, however,
of a different colour and texture, 'so the animals were never
quite the same.' One animal was cited as having lost its
hoofs as well, and in consequence it had to be kept in
slings until they grew again and hardened. The effects
of the Jumbai on horses, mules, donkeys, and pigs were
regarded as accidental&mdash;due to neglect or ignorance. The
plant was really encouraged to supply food for cattle, sheep,
and goats. The latter greedily devoured it and were not
perceptibly affected by it. It will be noticed that the
animals affected were non-ruminants, while those not affected
were ruminants. The probable explanation is that the
ruminants, by thoroughly mixing the food with saliva and
slowly digesting it, were enabled to neutralize the action of
the poison and escape injury. The seeds probably contain
the deleterious principle in a greater degree than any other
part of the plant. It was a common experience that animals
introduced from other localities suffered more than the
native animals. The latter were either immune or had learnt
to avoid the plant as noxious to them."</p>

<p>That animals resident in a district are not poisoned by
plants which are often fatal to sheep and cattle when on the
march through it, has been often observed in Australia.
The great "mobs" or droves of sheep passing slowly on
their travels through the bush to a new district are often
poisoned by the Caustic Creeper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euphorbia Drummondi</i>).
"The head swells to an enormous extent, becoming so heavy
that the animal cannot support it, and drags it along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
ground"; but this does not apparently happen to resident
cattle. Similarly for the Darling Pea or Indigo (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Swainsonia
galegifolia</i>). At one place this was growing abundantly
where some travelling horses were hobbled for the night.
"They had been on the road some nine weeks, and were up to
this date caught without any difficulty. On this occasion ...
their eyes were staring out of their heads, and they were
prancing against trees and shrubs.... When driven they
would suddenly stop, turn round and round, and keep
throwing their heads up as if they had been hit under the
jaw.... Two out of nine died, and five others had to be
left at the camp."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>In other natural orders we find one or two dangerous
plants amongst a whole series of perfectly harmless or useful
forms. The Oleander, in the Olive order, Corncockle
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis floscuculli</i>), in the Pink order, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lactuca Scariola</i>
amongst <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Compositæ</i> and others are all cases in point. So
also is the Yew amongst <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coniferæ</i>, etc.</p>

<p>How do animals recognize these particular plants as being
dangerous whilst all their allies are harmless? But the
reader will answer that they do not; it is well known that
animals <em>are</em> killed by eating poisonous plants, therefore poison
cannot possibly be any protection against animals.</p>

<p>This is one of those interesting questions in which the
suppression of apparently irrelevant details produces confusion.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, wild animals, or even domesticated
animals in nearly a wild state, do <em>not</em> eat the poisonous
plants of the country in which they and their forefathers
have been brought up&mdash;that is provided that they are
either adult or are accompanied by full-grown animals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Almost every case of cattle-poisoning in Great Britain occurs
when young calves, foals, or lambs are turned loose in the
fields without any mature older head amongst them. Sometimes
valuable stable-bred animals are lost, especially by
eating yew-leaves, but there are exceedingly few instances of
full-grown cattle being caught in such foolishness. When
cattle, horses, or sheep are turned loose in a new country,
plenty of cases do occur, and it is possible that they might
make mistakes with unknown foreign plants which had
escaped into their pastures here.</p>

<p>But almost every case of poisoning, even of cattle, shows
that it is young cattle who foolishly eat foxgloves, dropwort,
buttercup, etc., and occasionally die thereby.</p>

<p>Wild animals, who are of course brought up by their
mothers, never seem to be poisoned. They probably recognize
the dangerous plant by colour, smell, or taste. As a
matter of fact, many are rendered conspicuous by some lurid
sort of colour, such as bright red or purple. There is a
general garishness of appearance about many of them.
Aconite, Foxglove, Herb Paris, Henbane, and Nightshades
all show this peculiar appearance. In Java it is said that
the natives keep away wild pigs by planting hedges of certain
species with purplish-red leaves around their plantations.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting point of all is that it seems
to be quite justifiable to conclude that animals do, somehow,
manage to tell their offspring and each other what they
should and should not eat.</p>

<p>Youth, with its tendency to rash experiment, is thus kept
in check by the mature experience of age.</p>

<p>But it must be admitted that it is exceedingly difficult to
arrive at the facts in any particular case.</p>

<p>I shall be rash enough to give an opinion as to the actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
facts in connexion with the common Yew (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Taxus baccata</i>).
The seeds are poisonous to poultry and pheasants, but the
fleshy part round the seed is eaten with impunity by many
wild birds (blackbirds, etc.). The leaves are sometimes
poisonous and even fatal to horses, cattle, sheep, donkeys,
and goats, but they are not eaten by or are harmless to roedeer.
When, however, e.g., horses are killed by eating yew,
it is generally found that they have been grazing on cut-off
branches which have been left lying on the ground. In this
condition probably some specially poisonous substance is
developed in them.</p>

<p>As regards rabbits, it would be extremely comforting to
believe that they would eat yew-leaves or anything else
which would kill them, but, so far as one can judge, they can
eat all sorts of things which ought to do so with perfect
impunity.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T Christmas time and during late autumn, there is
but little colour in the country. Most green grasses
have become a dull greyish-green, and the leafless
brown and grey branches of the trees are not, at first sight,
particularly interesting.</p>

<p>But amongst this monotony of sober colouring, points of
bright red or flaming scarlet may be noticed here and there.
Sometimes it is a spray of Hips (the fruit of the Rose), or it
may be a cluster of Hawthorn berries. At Christmas the Holly
is positively gaudy with its bright scarlet fruit set off by the
shining dark green leaves.</p>

<p>Most fruits are some shade of red, but every fruit is conspicuous
and easily seen.</p>

<p class="smcap">Pineapples as a Field Crop</p>
<p>This is one of the important harvests in some parts of Queensland.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is the most extraordinary range in colour. The
Snowberry and Dwarf Cornel are pure white. The Mistletoe
is a yellowish green. Pure yellow fruits are not common, but
some of the Cucumber orders and Lemons are lemon or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
orange-yellow. The bluish-black of the Blaeberry or Bilberry,
of the Bramble, and of many Plums and Prunes, goes
along with a rather peculiar shade of green in the leaves which
sets them off. The black Elder berries, on the other hand,
have bright red or pink stalks which contrast prettily with
them. The colours of apples vary: many of them have been
rendered a gorgeous, glossy red through cultivation. One
of the most beautiful colour contrasts in Nature is found
in the rich black of the Olive, with its background of
shining white twigs and silver-green leaves. Another very
curious harmony is that of the Spindle tree fruit, which has a
hard dull red case that opens to display the seeds: these are
enclosed in a bright orange fleshy cup.</p>

<p>Changes often occur. The Lily of the Valley fruit is at
first green, then becomes flecked with red, and finally is a
rich scarlet. Juniper berries change from green to purple.</p>

<p>Now there is always some meaning in Nature for any series
of facts such as these. Why are these fruits so brightly
coloured and so conspicuous?</p>

<p>Birds and other animals are intended to scatter the fruits
and seeds, and so the fruits must be easily distinguished at a
distance. The seeds are taken to some other place, where
they germinate and form a new plant. This furnishes the
clue and guide to many other peculiarities in fruits and seeds.</p>

<p>The pleasant smell of ripe apples, plums, strawberries, and
other fruits, also attracts birds and other animals. But the
sugary juice and delicious flesh is developed entirely for the
purpose of making it worth a bird's while to eat it. The
amount of sugary matter is enormous, and the seeds seem
very small and inconspicuous compared with this luscious
mass. The sugar is produced very rapidly towards the end
of the ripening period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
A Cucurbita fruit, for instance, may increase in weight at
the rate of·0032 ounce per minute. All who have gathered
strawberries know how quickly they ripen.</p>

<p>The way in which the sugar is formed is not understood,
but unripe fruits contain bitter, unwholesome acids and
essences which may produce colic or very unpleasant effects
if the fruits are eaten green. Thus the colour is a guide to
the animal, who is not supposed to eat the fruit until it is
ripe; if eaten green, the seeds inside the fruit are quite destroyed
and cannot germinate. Yet animals are so greedy
that young birds, young animals of all sorts (even girls and
boys) will and do eat green or half-ripe fruit. In this
present year there is no doubt that many children have
suffered for having done this. Yet if we come to think of
it, throughout all the millions of years during which fruits
have ripened, Nature has every year clearly told young pterodactyls
and other lizards, young birds, young monkeys, and
young people to wait till the fruit is ripe. None of them
have learnt to do so.</p>

<p>When investigating by experiment, on the vile body, the
properties of plums, strawberries, and other fruits, you are
sure to find here and there one that has decayed and become
rotten. In most cases this is because a bird has pecked a
hole in it, or because the outside skin has been broken by a
wasp. The sugar has then begun to ferment. Why does it
do so?</p>

<p>If you gather a few fruits, put them into a jar of sugar-water,
and leave it after closing the mouth with a bunch of
cotton wool, then in a day or two fermentation begins and
alcohol is produced. That is because, on the outside of the
fruit, there were hundreds of an objectionable little fungus.
It lives upon sugar and turns the latter into alcohol. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
yeast fungus is really a living distillery. It lives in the
midst of alcohol all its life, dying eventually (like the
Duke of Clarence in his butt of Malmsey wine) by alcoholic
poisoning, which it has brought about by its own work.
This little yeast fungus can only be seen with a microscope.
From a rotten fruit it drops on to the ground, where it
remains all winter. Next spring certain small insects (green-fly
and the like) carry some of these yeasts from the earth to
next year's fruits. But the skin of the plum or apple, or the
hairs on a gooseberry, or the delicate, waxy bloom on a
grape, will prevent these insects or wasps from laying open
the sugar inside the fruit to the attacks of yeasts and other
fermenting fungi.</p>

<p>Some fruits appear to have "favourites"; they seem to
prefer that large animals should eat them. If you look carefully
at a piece of orange peel, and cut a small piece across,
you will see distinctly small resin pits full of a curious essence
which gives the characteristic taste to marmalade. This
bitter stuff will prevent wasps from touching the sugar. It
is, however, a valuable material, and some kinds of lemons, etc.,
are grown chiefly for this oil, which is obtained by scraping
the peel with a little saucer which is studded with short pins.</p>

<p>A still more extraordinary fruit is the prickly pear; this
is very delicious though very difficult to eat. Indeed, only
monkeys and man seem able to enjoy it. The sugary part
and the seeds form a little round mass in the inside. The
outside part, though also fleshy, contains hundreds of minute
mineral needles, which stick in the tongue and lips and cause
most painful inflammation. The monkey eats the prickly pear
with very great caution, getting his fingers into the top and
scooping out the sugary part. Man requires a teaspoon to
do this satisfactorily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Another very curious point about these fleshy fruits (and
also ordinary ones) is the strength of the seed inside. It does
not look very strong.</p>

<p>But an orange seed, for instance, will not be in the least
injured if you put it between two glass plates and gradually
press upon the upper one up to even a pressure of some thirty
pounds. Even hemp seed, which seems quite weak, will endure
a weight of four pounds. It is impossible to break a
prune stone, or to injure a date stone, by standing with your
whole weight upon it.</p>

<p>Such strength is necessary because many of these seeds are
eaten by birds and ground up in their crops with bits of
china, stones, shells, and the like, which the birds pick up just
to help them in crushing their food.</p>

<p>Fruits and seeds would seem to be exposed to some danger
when they are lying on the ground. Horses or other heavy
animals might tread on them. But the strength of seeds
and their shape is such that no harm is likely to accrue.
For instance, I arranged a thin layer of garden earth (a
quarter of an inch thick) on a glass plate; upon the earth
I placed four hemp seeds; then I put a 58-lb. weight on
the top of the seeds. They were not in the least injured,
although the seed of the hemp is not a particularly tough one.
Under such conditions the seed simply slips into the earth.</p>

<p>This is made easy for it on account of its shape, which is
generally rounded above and below. A transverse section of
a seed would be in shape like the arch of a bridge and its
shadow in the water, at least in many cases. There are also
usually wonderfully thickened cells in the shell or coat of a
seed, which makes it tough and strong.</p>

<p>The following are a few cases of strong seeds or fruits:&mdash;Cotton
seed bears a weight of 19 to 20 lb.; the hard fruits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of the Dogrose, 33 lb.; Castor-oil seed, 17 lb.; Hornbeam
nuts, 27 lb.; Pine seed (various sorts), from 11 to 22 lb.;
Yew seeds, 16 lb.; Peas, 50 to 56 lb. In every case they
are not at all hurt by these pressures.</p>

<p>As regards the animals for whom fruit or seeds are of
great importance, birds are of course the commonest. The
following is part of the bill-of-fare of a few of our common
birds:&mdash;Thrushes eat blaeberries (bilberries), brambles and
mulberries. Missel-thrush (or mavis) is especially fond of the
mistletoe.</p>

<p>Now the berry of the mistletoe is exceedingly sticky and
glutinous, and in the course of the bird's meal these sticky
strings get on to the bill and feathers, so that the mavis
wipes its bill on the branch of a tree. When it does so the
seed becomes attached to the branch, and is drawn close to
the latter when the viscous matter dries up, and so takes
root on the branch.</p>

<p>Nightingales and robins eat strawberries and elderberries;
blackbirds are very fond of strawberries, gooseberries, and
raspberries. Wood-pigeons eat beechmast, acorns, and, according
to Pliny, mistletoe-berries also, but this latter author
has not been confirmed by later observers. Some of the wild
African pigeons are exceedingly fond of castor-oil seeds.
When travelling through the Central African bush, it is
often necessary to shoot your dinner (if you are to have any
at all), and castor-oil bushes can be relied upon to produce
pigeons, if you are content with and are able to shoot them.</p>

<p>There is a widely-spread belief in the country that a great
quantity of berries means that a very severe winter is
going to follow. But as a matter of fact the winter of 1904
was not a severe one, and yet there were enormous quantities
of berries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
We are still ignorant of many details about birds and
berries. It is not quite clear how the seeds are not destroyed,
though experiments have shown that they are not injured, by
passing through the body of a bird. Kerner von Marilaun,
for instance, tried the fruits and seeds of 250 different plants
which were offered to seventeen birds, as well as to marmots,
horses, cattle, and pigs. He found that from seventy-five to
eighty-eight per cent. of the seeds germinated afterwards so
far as regards the blackbird, song-thrush, rock-thrush, and
robin. Quail also bring seeds from Greece and the Ionian
Islands to Sicily.</p>

<p>Mr. Clement Reid says: "Some years ago I found ...
in an old chalk-pit the remains of a wood-pigeon which
had met with some accident. Its crop was full of broad-beans,
all of which were growing well, though under ordinary
circumstances they would have been digested and destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Such accidents are common.</p>

<p>But it is not only birds which eat fleshy fruits and seeds.
Even the tiny, industrious ant drags about seeds of certain
plants. Sometimes they gather up corn or grasses, such as
ant-rice, and store them for use in winter. They even bite
off the growing root to prevent the seeds germinating and
spoiling. Occasionally they seem to carry the seeds by
accident, as, for example, those of the cow-wheat and a few
others which resemble their cocoons in size, colour, and form.
In other cases there is a little fleshy excrescence on the seed
which they are fond of eating. Cyclamen, snowdrop, violet,
and periwinkle seeds are supposed to be carried in this way.
Many animals occasionally or regularly eat fruits. There
are, for instance, the flying-foxes or fruit-eating bats of
Madagascar and tropical countries, which may be seen hanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
from the upper branches of trees by their toes, with their
heads tucked away under their wings. When disturbed a
little fox-like head appears, and after much chattering,
scolding, and expostulation, the creature unhooks itself and
flies away with a strong flight not unlike that of a crow.
Horses are occasionally fed on peaches in Chile. Rats eat
the coffee cherry, and do a great deal of harm in coffee
plantations.</p>

<p>In Cashmir the mulberry and other fruit trees are sometimes
visited by sportsmen, who often find bears feeding on
the fruits. Pigs, of course, eat all sorts of fruit, and several
other mammals do the same, but it is especially monkeys
that live chiefly on fruit. They plunder the banana plantations,
and in South Africa melon-patches require to be most
carefully watched to prevent baboons from destroying them.</p>

<p>It is said that the baboons watch the plantations from a
distance, and will only come down if they think no one is
there: so five people walk to the patch, and while four go
away again, one of them remains in hiding to shoot the
baboons, who cannot tell the difference between four and
five.</p>

<p>Man himself is, and has always been, a great eater of fruit.
Not only so, but he has enormously improved and altered
wild fruits until they are modified into monsters of the most
extraordinary kind. The ordinary wild gooseberry weighs
about 5 dwt. But even in the year 1786 some of the
cultivated forms weighed double this amount (10 dwt.),
and in 1852 gooseberries which weighed more than 37
dwt. were in existence. What size the largest big
gooseberry may be this year is not very easy to say, because
the public Press is at slack times too energetic about the
question. The most usual way of improving fruits is by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
selecting the finest specimens for reproduction. It is by this
means that the original wild banana, which is a rather small
fruit with very large seeds and very little flesh, has been
altered into something like 150 varieties, of which the
immense majority have no seed at all. This is a very extraordinary
fact, because the seed is the reason for the existence
of the fruit. Of course, all such varieties must be reproduced
by suckers (like the banana) or by grafts, or in some
such non-sexual manner. Seedless varieties exist of the
Cucumber, Fig, German Medlar, Diospyros, and Orange.</p>

<p>In the case of seedless varieties of the Vine, it has been found
that it is necessary to carry pollen to the flowers to fertilize
them, and the seedless fruit is also very much smaller in this
case, not more than a quarter of the size of one that has
seeds.</p>

<p>The following instance is typical of the manner in which
many well-known kinds of fruit have been developed, though
the perseverance shown by Mr. Gideon is certainly not common.
About the year 1855 this gentleman began planting
apple trees of about thirty named varieties. For nine years
he continued his experiments. He not only planted trees,
but also sowed apple seed sufficient to produce a thousand
trees every year. Yet the cold winters were so severe that
at the end of ten years one small seedling crab apple was
the solitary survivor. One seedling of this turned out to be
hardy enough for the climate of Minnesota, and this, the
"wealthy" apple, has been of great importance to the
Northern Mississippi growers. It is to be hoped that the
name has been justified in Mr. Gideon's case.</p>

<p class="smcap">Banana Carriers in Jamaica</p>
<p>A West Indian negro thinks nothing of walking twenty miles with loads such as these.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Many other cases could be mentioned of a chance variety
produced as a wild plant, and then propagated non-sexually
for long periods, e.g. the New Rochelle Bramble, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
found by the roadside, and which turned out to be exceedingly
valuable. It is by crossing or hybridizing that the most
extraordinary results have been obtained. Sometimes with
plums, the hybrids of the first generation are nearly double
the size of their parents. Some of the crosses are between
different plants. The Loganberry, for instance, is said to
be a cross between a Raspberry and a Bramble. It ripens
in July, and is said to be far in advance of either of its
parents as regards juiciness and acidity.</p>

<p>In most cases, however, the crosses are between well-established
varieties or races of the same species, and both
hybridizing and selection are employed to get the desired
result.</p>

<p>There are several tropical fruits which, with the possible
exception of wheat and oats, are more important to mankind
than anything else. The Breadfruit (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artocarpus incisus</i>),
which is very common in the South Sea Islands, has a large
fruit the size of a melon. When baked in an oven heated by
hot stones, it forms a satisfying meal: it is rather like new
bread, but has very little flavour. Coarse cloth is made of
its bark, and the wood is used as timber. The tree also has
a milky juice containing indiarubber, and is employed for
caulking the canoes. The most interesting point for
botanists about this plant is that the fruit is made up of
thousands of little flowers, and the fleshy part is really the
stalk. Fossil trees of this genus (of the chalk period) are
found in some parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Still more important to mankind is the Banana (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Musa
paradisiaca</i>). It is wheat, corn, and potatoes all in one, in
tropical and sub-tropical countries. It is found all over the
world wherever there is a hot, moist climate and shelter from
wind. It is a most generous plant as regards the amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
which it will produce. It will yield about 19-1/2 tons of dry
fruit on a single acre, which is about forty-four times the
amount given by potatoes and 133 times that of wheat.
Moreover, it differs from almost every other fruit in being
both "rice and prunes," that is, it is nutritious and wholesome,
and yet at the same time succulent. There are still
people who declare that the taste is that of "cotton wool
and Windsor soap," but that is a frivolous and unjust
remark. It is very difficult to prepare it exactly in the
right way for export to Great Britain, and the slightest
change in temperature or period of gathering has the most
distressing results.</p>

<p>As with many other tropical fruits, the countries where it
is most carefully produced and where the trade is most important
are just on the borders of the tropics. There
Europeans can keep enough vigour and vitality to supervise
and watch over the labour of natives. It is in the Canary
Islands, Queensland,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and Jamaica that the cultivation is
most carefully looked after. The yield may be from five
hundred to a thousand bunches per acre, and the value of
the trade is enormous. A plantation is not very beautiful,
because the huge leaves break up into irregular, ragged
pieces which look untidy. The flowers are visited by the
beautiful little honey-sucking sunbirds and humming-birds.
Monkeys also are very fond of the fruit.</p>

<p>In the tropics it grows everywhere, and with extremely
little trouble. It is a doubtful blessing to the negroes, for
they get their food so easily that they tend to become
incorrigibly lazy. Jam, champagne, brandy, and meal can
be made from the banana. When this meal can be prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
satisfactorily, it may partly replace wheat in temperate
countries. Besides this, the leaves are used for thatching,
and the stalks which make the stem contain a valuable
fibre which is used for string and rope.</p>

<p>In Egypt and all along the great deserts of Sahara and
Asia the graceful stately Date palm gives the favourite food
of the people (see Chap. <span class="smcap">X.</span>).</p>

<p>The Arabs grind up the stones to make food for camels,
and sometimes ferment the sap to make toddy. The trees
are either male or female. The Arabs knew that it was
necessary to pollinate the female flowers with male pollen
long before the meaning of the process was realized in
Europe.</p>

<p>The Fig, a native of the Persian Gulf, is cultivated all
along the Mediterranean and in India, Australia, and California.
It is sometimes fifteen to thirty feet high, and reaches
a very great age. There is one at Finisterre said to be
several centuries old. It yields fruit worth about £14 an
acre. The most interesting point about the Fig is the way
in which the Fig-wasp carries the pollen (see Chap. <span class="smcap">V.</span>).</p>

<p>Olives are also one of the most important and characteristic
Mediterranean trees. The crop in both Spain and
Italy is worth about £8,000,000 to £9,000,000 annually.
In California it is also successfully cultivated, and pays
very well. The peculiar taste of the dessert olive is obtained
by soaking it in lime or potash, and then in vinegar
or salt.</p>

<p>The Pineapple is one of the most delicious fruits, and is
interesting in every way. The little sharp spines on the
edges of the leaves keep animals off, and also make it a little
difficult to harvest. The workmen must wear leather
trousers to prevent their being cut and torn by the leaves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
In Queensland the pineapple is grown in big fields, and
about ten thousand fruits (worth about one penny each)
can be got from a single acre. It is also grown in the
West Indies, in India, and in other tropical countries. If
you examine the horny outside skin of the fruit with a sharp
penknife, you will find that each little piece of the mosaic is
a flower in itself; with a little care the bracts, three sepals,
three petals, and six stamens can be distinguished. The
whole stem and all its flowers unite to make a compound
fruit. Most varieties have no seeds. It is a native of South
America.</p>

<p>It is, however, our home fruits, Apples, Pears, Gooseberries,
Strawberries, Raspberries, and Currants, that are
most important to us in Britain. The Wild Crab Apple is
found from Drontheim, in Norway, to the Caucasus, and
grows over the whole of Europe. Apples were known to
the Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in our own climate there are great dangers
in the orchard. A touch of frost when the flowers are ripe
will very likely kill the tender, green, baby apple. It is
perhaps in Canada and North America that the growing of
apples and pears is most carefully looked after. Our beautiful
old orchards in Devonshire and other places, with comfortable
grass below the trees, and moss-covered, picturesque,
ancient trunks, are not found in the New World. The
regular lines of young trees in bare, carefully-kept earth,
with every stem whitewashed and treated with the most
scientific monotony, produce a most valuable return. But
in this country those who are careful and scientific sometimes
obtain extraordinary results. It is on record that a
man with a holding of twenty-nine acres near Birmingham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
made £600 a year from this small plot and paid £250 for
labour on it.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone also said that the future of British farmers
depended upon jam. Yet it must be remembered that
the trees take a long time to come into bearing, and the
crop is most uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE ways in which fruits and seeds are scattered abroad
over the face of the earth form one of the most
fascinating chapters in the story of Plant Life.</p>

<p>There is an infinite number of ingenious contrivances, so
many indeed that it is not at all easy to explain them.</p>

<p>However, suppose yourself seated on a grassy cliff near
Eastbourne or Brighton.</p>

<p>Looking lazily out over the blue waters, you see Norwegian
timber ships and steamers of all kinds, from the
little coasting "Puffing Billy" to the huge liner departing
for Australia or South Africa.</p>

<p>Plants are probably using every steamer; in the straw of
the packing cases, in the cargoes of corn or grain, in the ore,
and in the ballast, there are sure to be seeds. Such stowaways
are mostly weeds, but of course many valuable
garden, farm, orchard, and forest seeds are being intentionally
exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Looking down on the seashore, you will notice the high-water
mark, a yellowish brown line of floated rubbish which
is quite distinct even at a distance. If you now go down
and examine it closely (not a particularly pleasant operation,
seeing that so much is in a decomposing condition) you will
find many seeds amongst the corks and bits of straw, seaweed,
and objectionable, if lively, animalcula, and very
likely also pieces of plants, such as willow branches, which
might quite easily take root.</p>

<p>On the coast of Norway, and on our own western seaboard,
the fruits of a West Indian bean (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Entada scandens</i>)
are occasionally to be found, and its seeds are probably able
to germinate. We know that in long-past geological ages they
were floating round the estuary of the Thames, where they
occur as fossils. It has been found by experiment that fruits
and seeds are not killed although they have floated for a
year or more in salt water. Thus ocean currents are utilized
to carry fruits and seeds.</p>

<p>But from our comfortable seat on the South Downs, still
more can be learnt of wandering seeds. The wind which
blows across the downs carries with it hundreds of winged
or hairy fruits, all of them exquisitely fashioned as miniature
airships, aeroplanes, or other winged contrivances. The wind
is an important distributer of seeds.</p>

<p>One of the South Down sheep is trailing behind it a piece of
bramble which has caught in its wool; others, which have been
grazing on the broken cliff-edge where Agrimony, Forget-me-not,
and Burdock are flourishing, are certain to have spiny
or sticky fruits entangled in their wool. Animals therefore
carry seeds in their wool or fur. If it should happen to
be a fine, sunny afternoon, and if there are any plants of
Broom near by, it is quite likely that you may, every now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and then, hear a faint, sudden crack. This will be the Broom
at work scattering its seeds by itself. The little pod, when
it dries, contracts in such a way that it splits with a sudden
explosive pop, and the seeds are sent flying to a distance of
three or four feet. This curious fact was observed in 1546
by the naturalist Boek. The Whin and many other plants
act in the same way, for the dry fruit becomes elastic and
coils up spirally, flinging away the seed.</p>

<p>But here also, on the southern shore of England, we are
at a main station of arrival and departure for migrating
birds. A Landrail or other marsh bird might be flushed in
France, and might quite easily cross the Channel with
French mud sticking to its plumage. In this mud, or in its
crop, there may be seeds or fruits which will be left in an
English pond. This method is probably a very important
one, for these plants growing in duck-haunted places are
amongst the most widely distributed of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Reid has a very interesting discussion on this point.
The crow or rook could quite well cross the British Channel
now. In the days when Britain was covered with ice and
snow, the gap between the French and the English shore was
only half the present width. There was at that time
much flat land with oak forest bordering the French
coast.</p>

<p>Mr. Reid shows that it is probable that rooks regularly
carry about acorns in the cup, for he found seedling oaks
associated with empty acorn husks, stabbed and torn in a
peculiar way. "On October 29th of 1895, in the middle of an
extensive field, bordered by an oak copse and scattered trees,
I saw a flock of rooks feeding and passing singly backwards
and forwards to the oaks. On driving the birds away, and
walking to the middle of the field I found hundreds of empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
acorn husks and a number of half-eaten, pecked acorns."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
So that crows may have brought the acorns that colonized
Britain with oak forest in the earliest historical period.</p>

<p>Another means of dispersal is not so obvious on the South
Downs. In the Arctic region a glacier breaks away at its
tongue into icebergs, which float off and are stranded somewhere
perhaps hundreds of miles distant. Upon these icebergs
are stones and soil and plants which may be carried to
a great distance from their original place. In the Glacial
period or Great Ice Age, ice may have been an important
help in distributing plants, but at present it is difficult to
find a good example.</p>

<p>From all this it is clear that in order to carry plants to
new countries and new homes, everything that moves on the
earth's surface can be employed. Not only the wind, but
ocean currents, river waters, icebergs, and floating ice are
used. Migrating birds, mammals, and especially the most
restless and unsettled animal of all, viz. man, are at work
consciously and deliberately, or unconsciously and accidentally,
carrying the seeds to form new forest, grasslands, or
harvests in other countries.</p>

<p>The subject is in truth so vast that it is difficult to select
the most interesting and important cases.</p>

<p>The way in which squirrels, rats, voles, and lemmings
devour nuts and the like often leads to the distribution of
the fruit. A squirrel may, like a human being, forget where
its store was buried, or be driven from the place. Then
some of those forgotten nuts will grow into trees.</p>

<p>Birds are known to travel enormous distances. It is said
that one little Arctic bird travels from Heligoland to
Morocco in a single flight. It would not, at first sight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
seem likely that seeds and fruits could be carried by birds;
yet Darwin saw that this might possibly be the case. The
mud and slime in which so many birds find the small insects
which they require is full of seeds. An Austrian botanist,
Kerner von Marilaun, examined the mud scraped from the
beaks, feathers, and legs of a number of wading and marsh-birds.
He found in it the seeds of no less than thirty-one
different water and marsh plants (Grasses, Sedges, Toad-rush,
etc.). This showed, as is very often the case, that
Darwin was the first to discover a very important point. It
is also interesting to find that these ugly little freshwater mud
and marsh plants are at home almost everywhere, from the
Arctic circle to Tierra del Fuego and from Peru to Japan.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary cases known of sticking fruits and
spines are the Martynias and Harpagophytons of South
Africa. The fruit is covered by hooked claws, and becomes
a regular pest wherever it occurs. Deer, antelopes, and
other animals get their hoofs entangled in the fruit, and
the wretched creatures have to limp about until the hard
thorny fruit is trodden to pieces. Dr. Livingstone says that
the fruit gets into the nostrils of grazing animals which
cannot possibly remove it themselves, and so have to wait
patiently till the herdsman comes to take it out. According
to Lord Avebury, lions may sometimes be destroyed by these
horrible fruits. When a lion is rolling on the sand, the claws
(an inch long) stick in his skin, and when the lion tries to
tear it away with his teeth his mouth gets full of the fruits
and he cannot eat, and perishes miserably of starvation.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p class="smcap">A Cocoanut Grove in Ceylon</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some of our common British fruits are most perfectly
planned to stick or entangle themselves in the wool of sheep
or in people's clothes. These, such as the Goosegrass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
(Robin-run-the-Hedge), Burdock, Forget-me-not, Sanicle,
Avens, etc., have very often been described. It is only
necessary to examine one's clothes after a walk through
rough, broken ground to discover some of them, and the
ingenuity and neatness of their tiny hooks, harpoons, or
prongs can then be realized. We shall give one or two
instances of some other spiny plants. There is, for instance,
Xanthium, which is one of the Daisy flowers or Composites.
Unlike most of this order, its little fruits possess no wind-hairs.
The outside of the head of flowers is covered by
strong curved little crooks. These get so entangled in wool
or hair that they become a perfect pest to wool merchants.
In 1814 Xanthium was unknown in the Crimea, but by 1856
it had covered the whole of the peninsula. In 1828 the
Russian cavalry horses brought it on their manes and tails
into Wallachia, from whence it travelled to Servia. Servian
pigs carried it into Hungary. In 1830 it was taken in wool to
Vienna. By 1871 it had reached Paris and Edinburgh. In
1860 Frauenfeld saw horses in Chile whose manes and tails
were so felted together with thousands of these fruits that
the animals could scarcely walk. In Australia, where it first
appeared in 1850, it has caused a very serious loss to the
wool merchants and squatters. The loss has been put at
50 per cent. by some authorities.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>We have already alluded to the transference of fruits and
seeds by ocean currents. In the <em>Challenger</em> expedition, no
less than ninety-seven kinds of marine floating fruits were
observed.</p>

<p>Amongst these the most important is the Cocoanut. The
nut sold in this country is not the whole fruit, but only the
inside shell. In the natural state this is enclosed in a dense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
mass of fibres, which form the valuable "coir" used for
brushmaking and a variety of purposes.</p>

<p>The entire outside of the fruit is covered by a smooth
white skin. The whole fruit is about the size of a man's
head, and is so light that it floats easily in the water. It
has in fact been carried by the waves to uninhabited islands
all over the South Seas. It is a very great blessing to
Polynesia, for a tree yields thirty to fifty nuts, and four of
these nuts will furnish enough food for one day. Coprah and
the oil extracted by boiling the inside are also valuable.
Spirit or toddy can be made from the young buds. The
leaves are used for thatching and the trunk for timber.</p>

<p>There are other very curious palm fruits which are also
carried by water. Sir Joseph Hooker mentions the large,
round fruits of Nipa, as big as a cannon-ball, turned over by
the paddles of the steamer in the muddy waters at the
Ganges mouth (<cite>Himalayan Journal</cite>).</p>

<p>In this country a search in the rubbish left by a spate or
freshet along a riverside is sure to furnish many floating
fruits or seeds. Most of these are small and rather difficult
to see. Perhaps the most interesting are those of the
Sedges. The real fruit is only about one-sixteenth of an
inch in size, but it is enclosed in a little sack or bag a quarter
of an inch long and with a narrow opening, so that it floats
quite easily. Many willow branches, pondweeds, hornweeds,
and the like, are also found in the rubbish left by floods, and
these can often take root.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the exquisite modifications of those
fruits which are blown by the wind that we find the most
beautiful contrivances of all. They are effective also.
Seeds are often so small as to be like dust particles, and
such may be carried in the air to almost incredible distances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
That of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Goodyera repens</i> weighs only 1/200,000,000 of a pound,
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monotropa</i>, ·000,000,006 lb. It is no doubt by the
wind that the spores of lichens are carried from one
mountain to another. On a map of the world the distance
from the Arctic to the Antarctic, between the North
and South Poles, seems enormous. Moreover, the amount of
water, desert, tropical forest, and cultivated land in this
extent of country is very great. There are but few rocks
on which lichens could manage to grow. And yet of the
Antarctic Lichens in the South Polar regions, and which are
also European species, more than 73 per cent. are found in
the Arctic or North Polar regions.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>An Arctic lichen spore probably travelled from Scandinavia
to the German and Swiss Alps, another journey took
it to the Atlas Mountains, thence to Abyssinia, again to
Mount Kenia, and from there, somehow, it wandered to the
South Orkneys or King Edward VII Land.</p>

<p>While talking of lichens, one must not forget the Manna
of the Bible (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lecanora esculenta</i>) and two other species,
which form warted, wrinkled masses on rocks. It breaks off
and may be carried away by the wind, or in heavy rain it
may be washed into depressions of the soil, where a man can
pick up 8 to 12 lb. in a day.</p>

<p>It "is used as a substitute for corn in years of famine&mdash;being
ground in the same way and baked into bread.... It is
also remarkable that all the great so-called rains of manna,
of which news has come from the East to Europe, especially
those of the years 1824, 1828, 1841, 1846, 1863, and 1864,
occurred at the beginning of the year, between January and
March, i.e. at the time of the heaviest rains.... The inhabitants
of the district actually thought that the manna had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
fallen from heaven, and quite overlooked the fact that this
vegetable structure grew and developed (although only in
isolated patches and principally as crusts on stones) in the
immediate neighbourhood of the spots where they collected
it."<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the wind-blown fruits and seeds there are cases in
which entire plants are dragged out of the soil and hurried
away by the wind, which rolls them over and over. They
may be blown along for days together. The seeds drop out
by the way. In this country one rarely sees anything of the
sort, but in the Prairies of North America, when under
cultivation, these tumble-weeds are a serious and expensive
pest. Sometimes the farmers dig trenches to catch them, or
they may put up fences against which the tumble-weeds
become piled or heaped up until they blow over the top.</p>

<p>It is not very much use to give the names of these weeds,
for they are mostly rare or not British species. Such tumble-weeds
are generally nearly spherical in general form and
have a short, rather weak, root which is easily torn out of
the ground. In some grasses, such as "Old Witch," a well-known
pest of the United States, the grass-stalk, with many
flowers on it, is pulled out of its sheath and blown away.</p>

<p>But it is more usual for the fruits or seeds themselves to
break off the parent plant, and to be carried away by the
wind. To this end we find the most extraordinary changes.
Although the flower may droop from its stalk, the latter
becomes upright and grows quite a considerable length when
the seed or fruit is dispatched on its wanderings. This will
raise the fruit or seed as high as possible above the surrounding
grasses.</p>

<p>Then in some cases the fruit opens to allow the seed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
escape. Small holes appear in it, or the fruit splits. As the
dry, elastic, withered stalk swings to and fro in the wind,
the seeds are swung out of these openings, and starting with
a certain momentum the wind will carry them often to a
surprising distance from their parents. In wet or rainy
weather these holes or slits generally close together, and no
seeds are sent forth on their travels. The little holes in the
top of a poppy-head by which the seeds are swung out
have little flaps, which close over and shut them up in wet
weather.</p>

<p>Some plants make a sort of catapult to sling or hurl their
fruits. Kerner von Marilaun was the first to describe some
of these curious arrangements. He had brought home some
fruits of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dorycnium herbaceum</i> and laid them on his writing-table.
"Next day as I sat reading near the table, one of
the seeds of the Dorycnium was suddenly jerked with great
violence into my face." Some of the neatest catapult fruits
are those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teucrium flavum</i>. (There is a British species,
the Woodsage, but it has not got the same arrangement.)
When the petals have fallen off, the four small fruits are left
inside the cup-like sepals; the flower-stalk when dry is very
elastic, and if an animal touches the sepals it swings violently
and shoots out one of the fruits. But that is by no means
the whole of the process: there are hairs arranged spirally in
the throat of the sepals, and these give a spin or twirling
motion like that of a rifle-bullet to the fruit. The fruit also
flies out of the sepals in a line of flight which is inclined at
an angle of about forty-five degrees to the horizon; at this
angle, as is well known, the trajectory or distance travelled
will be the greatest possible.</p>

<p>But by far the best way to understand these questions is
to try with some common weeds in the country towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the end of summer or beginning of autumn. If either the
Cow Parsnip or wild Angelica, or Myrrhis, be gathered and
kept till it is quite dry, then if you take it by the stalk and
swing it to the full extent of the arms the fruits fly off to
fifteen (or more) feet away. Every part is elastic&mdash;not
only the main stalk, but the thin separate stalks of the
flowers and also the delicate piece by which each half-fruit
is attached. The half-fruits themselves are also so
made that they are of exactly the right shape to take a
long flight.</p>

<p>Ever since the days of Icarus, one of the unsatisfied ambitions
of mankind has been to fly like a bird, to "soar into
the empyrean," and to be no longer chained to the earth's
surface.</p>

<p>It is a very curious study, that of the many and diverse
inventions, almost always useless and very often fatal, by
which men have endeavoured to solve this problem. Every
one of these can be paralleled amongst the many neat contrivances
of wind-borne fruits and seeds. The principle of
the "parachute," which is more or less like an umbrella, is
found in both fruits and seeds. One of the most beautiful
is the Dandelion fruit, where a series of the most exquisite
branched hairs springs from the top of the slender shaft
which carries the little hard fruit. Most of the Composite
or Dandelion order have, however, more of the "shuttlecock"
idea. There is a row or crown of stiff and spreading
or feathery hairs.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The classical person above alluded to seems to have
copied the bird's wing, sticking on feathers with wax, which
of course melted in the sun with the usual result to the
inventor of flying machines. Many seeds have regular
wings which act like those of the bat or flying squirrel. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
of the most exquisite of all is the seed of Bignonia. The
Dahlia fruit has also a flying wing, and a great many others
might be mentioned. Major Baden-Powell experimented
with kites, which were supposed to raise a man high enough
in the air to take observations of the enemy's movements.
But a most exquisite "kite" is that of the Lime tree. The
little fruit is hung from a broad, flying bract, and as it very
slowly sinks to the ground it solemnly turns round and
round. That is because the pressure of the air acts on the
flat bract just as it does on an aeroplane, and forces it to
revolve. So the fruit remains a long time in the air, and
may be carried to nearly a hundred yards away from its
parent tree.</p>

<p>The Traveller's Joy (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis</i>) and the Cotton have
their seeds covered all over by many entangled hairs, which
act like a piece of fluff, so that the wind blows the seed
away.</p>

<p>No one has discovered the original wild Cotton plant.
The robes of the priests in Egyptian temples were made of
it. It was introduced into Spain by the Arabs when they
invaded that country. When the Spaniards attacked the
half-civilized Indian people of Central and South America,
they found cotton was regularly cultivated there. Its
history in England is rather interesting. In the days of
Queen Elizabeth the great English industry was the production
of woollen cloth from Yorkshire sheep. A penalty
of £20 was imposed, even as late as 1720, on any person
who imported or even wore cotton cloths. Yet this was
unable to stop the growth of the trade which, thanks to the
Flemings and Huguenots who took refuge from religious
persecution in this country, eventually became our gigantic
textile industry employing millions of factory hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
The advantage of these wings and hairs is at once seen if
one compares the time that a fruit or seed takes to fall
through a given height, first with its wings or hairs, and then
after they have been cut off.</p>

<p>An Artichoke fruit, for instance, will take nearly eight
seconds to reach the ground from a height of a few feet.
But if you cut away its hairs, it will touch the ground in
a little more than one second. A Sycamore fruit of which
the wing has been removed falls to the ground in about
a quarter of the time that it takes when it has not been
injured, so that the wing helps it to fly to four times the
distance that it could reach if it had none. The Ash fruit
also remains twice as long in the air as it would do if it had
no wing; and so on.</p>

<p>We shall finish this chapter by describing two very extraordinary
cases.</p>

<p>The Sandbox tree is a native of tropical America. The
fruit, as large as an orange, consists of a number of rounded
pieces, each with a single seed inside. When ripe each piece
splits off, making a noise like the report of a pistol. The
plant is sometimes called the Monkey's Dinner Bell. These
pieces may be thrown to a distance of fifty-seven feet from
the parent plant.</p>

<p>Even more remarkable are the hygroscopic grasses. There
are four of them, which are widely separated as regards
distribution, for one (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stipa capillata</i>) lives in Russia, another
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stipa spartea</i>) in North America, a third (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristida hygrometrica</i>)
is found in Queensland (Australia), and the fourth
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heteropogon contortus</i>) belongs to New Caledonia.</p>

<p>Yet all these four grasses are said to kill sheep, and do so
in a manner that is almost identical. The mechanism is as
follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
The fruit is like that of most grasses, enclosed in a folded
leaf, the bract (or glume), which in these particular cases is
produced into a very long fine tapering hair or awn. This
awn is sensitive to changes in the <em>moisture</em> of the air. It is
strongly hygrometric: in wet weather it straightens itself,
and it coils into corkscrew spirals in dry weather. The
widened part of the base, which contains the grain, tapers
into a sharp, very hard point; upon this there are, on the
outside, many stiff hairs, which point backwards away from
the sharp tip.</p>

<p>Now, suppose this fruit to fall on the ground, the awn or
tail is sure to be entangled in neighbouring grasses or herbs,
but the hard point will rest upon the ground. Every coil
and twist made by the entangled awn or tail will push the
point a little deeper into the earth, and the backward-pointing
stiff hairs will prevent its being pulled out of the
soil.</p>

<p>Therefore all these modified contrivances ensure that the
seed will bury itself.</p>

<p>But supposing that one of these fruits falls upon a
sheep's back. Then an exactly similar process will go
on. The seed will be forced through the skin into the
body of the sheep. In fact, if it should fall above any soft
or vulnerable part of the animal, the sheep will very likely
be killed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, sheep are said to be killed by these
grasses in all those four countries, distant though they are
from one another.</p>

<p>We have endeavoured in this chapter to give some faint
notion of the hundreds and thousands of ingenious contrivances
utilized by plants in order to ensure the dispersal
and future prosperity of their children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Every species is always trying to colonize new ground, to
seek fresh fields and new pastures. Plants are not content
to keep to the old habitats, but every species tries to scatter
its pioneers over all the neighbouring country, so that, as
often happens, if it is exterminated or suppressed in one
locality, new generations luxuriate elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is difficult to understand the amount of labour and toil
that has been spent on farmlands and pastures, if one
only considers England.</p>

<p>It is often impossible to discover one square mile still
covered by the natural wild plants. It is all under corn or
arable, or rich artificial meadowland.</p>

<p>But from a Scotch hillside, as one looks down at the fertile
valley below, one can see <em>first</em> where the mosaic of hedges and
dykes stops, <em>then</em> where, after a narrow stretch of rough grass
pasture, the cultivation ends; finally, where, ridge after
ridge, rolling, heathery moorland, without enclosures and
without any sign of man's handiwork, rises up to the highest
peaks.</p>

<p>This fills one with a respect and reverence towards our
forbears, which is increased by a study of corn, turnips, and
potatoes.</p>

<p>Every one of these plants is a thoroughly unnatural,
artificially bloated, and overfed sort of creature. Its constitution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
as is usual with those who habitually overeat themselves,
is delicate and unsound.</p>

<p>No cultivated plant could exist for more than a season if
man did not look after it and protect it from its rivals and
weeds. Moreover, they are a curiously assorted lot.</p>

<p>Wheat probably came from Asia Minor, Swedes from
Scandinavia, Mangelwurzel from the Mediterranean, and
Potatoes from Chile. Turnips and Carrots are indeed
native Britishers, though the original wild carrot or
turnip would never be recognized as such by any ordinary
person.</p>

<p>The history of every one of them is interesting. The
Oat is the true Teutonic and Scandinavian grain, which has
more "fibre" than any other cereal. There is an interesting
passage in Froissart's <i>Chronicles</i> describing the commissariat
of those hardy Scotch borderers who raided and
ruined the northern English counties whenever they felt
inclined to do so.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> They lived for the most part on the
cattle of their enemies, but each man carried a small sack of
oatmeal and a griddle, or iron plate, on which to make oatcake.
So that each man supported himself. His little
rough pony also was quite able to look after itself.</p>

<p>That hardy plant, the Oat (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Avena sativa</i>) can be cultivated
as far north as 69.50° N. lat. It is a native of
Siberia and Western Europe.</p>

<p>It was oatmeal that supported the Norsemen who conquered
Normandy and England, and who even dominated
the Mediterranean. The Swedes of Gustavus Adolphus and
the Danes of Canute also lived mainly upon oatmeal and
porridge. It is true that in England oats are abandoned to
the horses, but those horses are the best in the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
There can, of course, be no question as to whether the
Scotch or English are the best!</p>

<p>The history of Wheat is a very complicated one; there
are a great number of varieties and sub-species, all closely
allied to our ordinary wheat, and difficult to distinguish
from it. One variety occurs as a wild plant from Mesopotamia,
near Ararat, over Servia, the Crimea, and as far as
Thessaly, where entire hills are covered by it. This grain
seems to have been cultivated at Troy, for Dr. Schliemann
has found it at Hissarlik. It was, however, in cultivation
long before the days of Achilles; it was grown by the Stone
Age people, who lived in the lake dwellings of Switzerland.
Another kind, "spelt" wheat, seems to have been the mainstay
in ancient Egypt, in Greece, and all through the
Roman Empire. It is now very rare, though it is still grown
in Spain and in other countries where the soil is poor.</p>

<p>Grains of the true Wheat have been discovered in the
Pyramids of Egypt, so that it also is very ancient. To-day
Wheat extends to Norway (69° N. lat.), and may be grown
up to 4400 feet on the Alps.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> India, United States, Russia,
the Argentine, Chile, Australia, and many other countries,
produce great crops of this useful and nourishing food. Its
fibre is 3 per cent., albuminous matter 11-1/2 per cent., and
carbo-hydrates 66·5 per cent. Oat has 10 per cent. fibre,
11-1/2 per cent. albuminous, and 57 per cent. carbo-hydrates.</p>

<p>One guess as to the origin of Wheat is that the first-named
(Mesopotamian sort) is the original wild plant. By
cultivation in the rich alluvial valleys of Mesopotamia and
Egypt, improved kinds were formed. These have eventually
replaced both "spelt" wheat and the wild race, but could
only do so when richly-cultivated fields were ready for them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
On poor soil and with bad cultivation, "spelt" is said to be
even now the most profitable crop.</p>

<p>Wild Barley grows in Arabia and from Asia Minor to
Baluchistan. It is very important in the colder regions of
Northern Europe, in Tibet, and in China, but with us "John
Barleycorn" is chiefly used for brewing.</p>

<p>Rye also comes from Asia Minor. It was not apparently
known in Europe until the Bronze period, but is now "the
chief cereal of the German and Slavonic nations." The
black rye-bread is familiar to all who have travelled on the
Continent. The straw is good fodder, and is used for
making hats and for paper.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>A very interesting point on which, however, it is quite
impossible to come to a definite decision, may be noticed
here. We will suppose what is quite as likely as any other
theory, viz. that man as a gardening creature first settled
somewhere in the Euphrates or Caucasian valleys.</p>

<p>What wild plants, then, would have been available for his
experiments?</p>

<p>This particular region is an interesting and remarkable
one. Most of our common British plants occur along the
shore of the Black Sea to the Caucasus (apple, pear, nut,
turnip, cabbage, carrot, and others, are all probably to be
found there). On the Babylonian side of the mountains,
there is a warm sub-tropical climate in which almost every
useful plant can be grown. The desert also contains a few
other valuable plants.</p>

<p>Near Ararat, Noah might have found rye, wheat, and
barley growing wild. The Wild Vine also grows on the south
of the Caucasus. "It grows there with the luxuriant wildness
of a tropical creeper, clinging to tall trees and producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
abundant fruit without pruning or cultivation."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In that
favoured district, the olive and the fig, the melon and
cucumber, onions, garlic, and shallots, and other common
garden and medicinal plants, can be found. Not far away is
the native country of the camel, the ass, the horse, and most
other domestic animals.</p>

<p class="smcap">Ricefields in the Ceylon Hills</p>
<p>The buffaloes are puddling up the soil before the seed is planted.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Were these hillsides of Ararat or thereabouts, the first
place where man sowed and reaped a harvest?</p>

<p>At any rate, in those flat, fertile, alluvial plains of the
Euphrates, and also in Egypt, the first great cities arose.</p>

<p>But even in the later Stone Age, which may have been
about 58,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, some of these Caucasian plants seem to
have been in cultivation in Switzerland. Probably every
subsequent invasion, first that of races with bronze weapons,
and then of others in the Iron Age, brought with it new
cultivated plants.</p>

<p>The Oat seems to be an exception to the rule, for, so far as
one can gather, it was not a native of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The first harvest was, however, in all probability, a very
casual and occasional kind of thing.</p>

<p>Mason (<cite>Origin of Inventions</cite>, page <a href="#Page_192">192</a>) has described
such a kind of cultivation which was in existence amongst
the American Indians quite recently. "A company of
Cocopa or Mohave or Pima women set forth to a rich and
favoured spot on the side of a cañon or rocky steep. They
are guarded by a sufficient number of men from capture or
molestation. Each woman has a little bag of gourd seed,
and when the company reach their destination she proceeds
to plant the seeds one by one in a rich cranny or crevice
where the roots may have opportunity to hold, the sun may
shine in, and the vines with their fruit may swing down as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
from a trellis. The planters then go home and take no
further notice of their vines until they return in the autumn
to gather the gourds" (E. Palmer).</p>

<p>There is an interesting point about the cultivation of
those early savage peoples who built up for themselves unhealthy
but elaborate wooden dwellings in the Swiss lakes, in
order to escape wild beasts and human beings who were
even more dangerous and ferocious than they.</p>

<p>Weeds occurred in those cornfields, cultivated by stone
implements, some 60,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The seed of an Italian weed had been introduced with
their corn, and was discovered in Switzerland!</p>

<p>Weeds are an extremely interesting group. A proverb
about the hardiness and multiplication of weeds can be discovered
in almost every language. "Ill weeds grow apace,"
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unkraut verbessert nicht</i>, and so on. They are very common.
In fact weeds, wayside, and freshwater plants, have by far the
widest distribution of all. There are twenty-five species
which can be found over at least half the entire land surface
of the earth, and more than a hundred occupy a third of it.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, many of our common weeds existed in Britain
when the glaciers and ice melted away, and there were as yet
no people able to cultivate the ground.</p>

<p>The Creeping Buttercup, Chickweed, Mint, Persicaria,
Dock, and Sheep's Sorrel had already colonized the country,
before the Great Ice Age came upon them, and at least fourteen
weeds were here when the first corn-raising savages
landed in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>At first sight it is difficult to understand where and how
they lived. One discovers a very few, however, if one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
botanizes very carefully along the seashore, or on river banks
where landslips have occurred, and in other such places
where bare ground exists which is not the result of cultivation.</p>

<p>There these weeds fulfil a very important and useful
purpose. The "red smear" of a landslip is soon tinted
green with Coltsfoot, Chickweed and the like, and the bare
earth, which was useless and supported no green covering, is
very soon made once more a part of the earth's fruitful field.
In such places the weeds are soon overcome and suppressed by
the regular woods, grass, or thicket of the district.</p>

<p>It is far otherwise in arable land, where man desires to
keep the ground bare in order to give his own domestic
plants the best part of the soil.</p>

<p>Let us look for a little at what actually happens in an
ordinary cornfield. It is not merely one generation of weeds,
but whole armies, that the farmer has to contend with.</p>

<p>When the young corn is growing up (1) the bright yellow
Charlock grows much more rapidly, and the whole cornfield
is golden with it. The Charlock grows to some eighteen
inches high, flowers, and sets its seed before it is suppressed
by the growth of the cornstalks, which, of course, may be
three or four feet or more in height.</p>

<p>(2) Another series of weeds, such as Spurrey, are growing
in the shelter of the tall stalks, and their flowers are ripened
and their seed scattered long before the corn is cut.
(3) Another series, such as Polygonums, etc., become ripe
and are about the length of the corn, so that when it is cut
and thrashed the seed of the Polygonum accompanies the
grain and is probably sown with it. (4) Then there are
such weeds as the False Oat grass, etc., which are taller than
the Oat, and whose seeds are blown off and scattered all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the field before the harvest. One would think that those
exhausted the series, but far from it: the farmer cuts and
carries the crop, and for two or three days the ground is
almost bare, but if you revisit the field a week afterwards
you can no longer see the ground. The cut-off yellow stalks
of the corn are set off by a dark continuous green carpet of
flourishing weeds. This last, (5) the "waiting division"
of the weeds, remain quietly until the corn is removed and
then get through their flowering and seeding before the field
is ploughed up or covered by grass.</p>

<p>Now if one thinks for a little over the cunning and
ingenuity of these proceedings, it is obvious that each single
weed has somehow learnt how to develop exactly at the right
time. Those especially which are intended (by themselves)
to form part of the seed mixtures must flower exactly at the
same time as the corn. As a matter of fact, most seed
mixtures are often full of weeds. In a single pound of
clover seed, no less than 14,400 foreign seeds, including those
of forty-four different weeds, have been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Others scattered on the ground will probably be buried
and remain five to seven years below the surface, yet they
are ready to come up flourishing as soon as they get a chance.</p>

<p>How has this been brought about? It is only since about
1780 to 1820 that our present system of farming has
prevailed. In these 125 years, these weeds have found out
exactly how to establish themselves.</p>

<p>The explanation is probably a very simple one. Every
weed which did not bloom and seed exactly at the right
time was killed and left no seed. This encouraged the
others, who have gradually brought about the neat little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
arrangements above described. A process of selection has
been at work. Those that would not modify their arrangements
to suit new methods of farming have been suppressed.</p>

<p>But it is in some of the cultivated plants themselves that
one sees the most extraordinary results of selection.</p>

<p>The Wild Cabbage is still to be found on sea-cliffs on the
south-western coast of England, and the Wild Turnip
occasionally occurs in fields. There is nothing particularly
interesting or attractive about either of them.</p>

<p>Yet from the one has been produced cabbage, cauliflower,
seakale, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and kohlrabi; and the
other has given the endless varieties of turnips. For the
most part these extraordinary changes have been brought
about in a perfectly straightforward way, by just choosing the
biggest and finest sorts for seed.</p>

<p>Some of the feats performed by gardeners in this way are
almost incredible. A United States seedsman evolved the
idea of a perfect bean from his inner consciousness. It had
a particular shape which he described to a noted grower of
beans. Two years later his ideal bean was produced!</p>

<p>The growers of pineapples used to have a great deal of
difficulty on account of the pineapple cuttings becoming
unhealthy. Sometimes 63 per cent. were more or less
diseased. Then certain growers began to carefully select
disease-proof pineapples, and finally reduced the percentage
of diseased cuttings to four per cent. Another French observer
(M. Roujon) by continually selecting the smallest seeds, was
able to obtain corn only eight inches high.</p>

<p>But by far the most interesting and important researches
have been those dealing with roots and tubers. Several
people have, in fact, done in a few years what it took primitive
man centuries to accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Thus, in 1890, E. v. Proskowetz obtained some seeds of
the wild Sea-beetroot which is found on the south coast
of France. By very careful selection he was able in the year
1894 to get good beetroots quite like the ordinary cultivated
ones. These were biennials (not annuals like the wild plant),
and had a large percentage of sugar&mdash;16·99 per cent. This
was by selection in good and fertile soil.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Vilmorin also
obtained quite good carrots in the fourth generation by cultivating
the wild form in rich and good soil, and selecting
the best.</p>

<p>In fact there are in natural wild plants great differences
between individuals, and when such plants are cultivated in
good soil, where they have far more to eat than they require,
the result is that they produce extraordinary and monstrous
types.</p>

<p>These types are, however, more or less delicate, and are
weak in constitution and easily killed. To prevent such
variations those who wish to keep a race of seed pure are
careful to keep it growing on poor land.</p>

<p>In 1596 the Hyacinth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hyacinthus orientalis</i>) was introduced
from the Levant. In 1597 there were four varieties,
and in 1629 eight kinds were known, but in 1768 two
thousand forms of hyacinth were named and described.</p>

<p>Besides selection, the method of hybridizing or crossing is
often used in order to obtain new or valuable strains.
Generally both hybridizing and crossing are employed.
This method has long been practised. Bradley, in 1717,
writes as follows: "A curious person may by this knowledge
produce much rare kinds of plants as have not yet been
heard of"; and, in fact, peaches, potatoes, plums, strawberries,
and savoys have all been greatly improved by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
hybridizing and selection.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> By crossing certain kinds of
corn, such as the Chinese Oat and the wild European Oat,
varieties have been produced by Messrs. Garton which at the
Highland and Agricultural Society's trials produced 84, 87,
and 99 bushels per acre, as compared with 58 bushels yielded
by the ordinary Scotch Oat.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> With potatoes also astonishing
results have been got.</p>

<p>One single potato was sold for £50 not very long ago.</p>

<p>The Potato, like the Indian corn, tobacco, and a few other
plants, is an inhabitant of the New World. Of other
cultivated plants the native country is not known. No one
knows where, for instance, Sugar-cane was first cultivated,
but it has nine Sanskrit names, one of which, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">khand</i>, is, or
has probably at one time been familiar to us as sugar-candy.
It was well-known when the Institutes of Manu were written,
but that may have been somewhere between 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 20.</p>

<p>One of the Hindu Indian deities, Kámadeva, who corresponds
to Cupid, the God of Love, carries a bow made of
sugar-cane, with a string which is composed of bees.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line i0h">Which through five senses pierce enraptured hearts."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From India it seems to have been carried by Alexander
the Great to Asia Minor, for it is mentioned by Herodotus.
In the time of the Crusades it was discovered in Syria, and
the Venetians learned something about it when the Crusaders
returned to Europe. The Spaniards introduced the Sugar-cane
to the Canary Islands in 1470. Then the Dutch took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
it to Brazil, and when they were expelled from that country
by the Portuguese they transferred their canes to the West
Indian Islands. Our English islands, Barbados (1643) and
Jamaica (1664), soon found the cultivation a very profitable
undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The variations in price of sugar became in process of time
of a very serious nature. In the year 1329 it is said that in
Scotland a pound of sugar was worth one ounce of standard
silver. But from 1780 to 1800 the price fell to 9d. The
East Indian sugar began to compete with that from the
West Indies about this time, but this was very soon crushed
out by imposing a duty of £37 per cwt.</p>

<p>The West Indies were then very flourishing, but even
before this the fatal word <i>beet-sugar</i> had already been heard.
It was nothing at first but an interesting experiment by
Professor Marcgraf in a German laboratory, who had extracted
a little cane-sugar from beetroot in 1747. But in
1801 the beet was already in cultivation. Napoleon saw
England's monopoly of the cane and judiciously encouraged
the beet. The result of his far-seeing policy only became
manifest a few years ago, for then the West Indian Islands,
which we conquered and guarded against Napoleon at such
fearful expense of blood and treasure, were almost worthless;
Continental beet-sugar had ruined our colonial planters and
our home refineries. It is in fact a most curious and interesting
example of how a little judicious encouragement
by a wise and far-seeing Government may destroy the profits
of victory in a long, glorious, but yet ruinous war.</p>

Rose tree attacked by an aphis or green-fly may be succoured
by the slim ichneumon, or other thin-waisted fly, which
lays its egg in that of the aphis. Another insect, say a
spider, catches the ichneumon. A starling may eat the
spider, and be itself eaten by an owl.</p>

<p>So that ichneumon and starling are friends to the Rose,
whilst the other insect, the spider, and the owl are enemies.
Yet both the starling and the spider are probably, almost
certainly on the whole, friends of the Rose, although they
are unfriendly in this special case.</p>

<p>With all other similar series or changes the final term
is either a bird or animal of prey or mankind.</p>

<p>Until we introduce the idea of man as the culminating
point of the series, the whole of it seems to be without any
special meaning or advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
But when we think of how man utilizes the work of plants
and animals, then the whole scheme becomes intelligible and
complete; it is like a well-rounded story with a worthy and
adequate end.</p>

<p>Moreover, what man has done so far is only an instalment
of what he will probably succeed in doing. All who have
brought up caterpillars or bees know that their greatest
difficulty arises from certain minute insects or fungus
enemies. We already know enough about these latter to
fight them with some chance of success, but there are
hundreds of other spores and germs floating in the atmosphere,
and coming to rest on animals, on clothing, or on the
leaves or petals of plants. These germs are now just as wild
as, and infinitely more dangerous than the furious aurochs,
the disdainful wild asses, or the ferocious wolves that our
forefathers succeeded in domesticating.</p>

<p>Those bacteria, or germs, for instance, which are only
one-thousandth of a millimetre long, are only visible by the
help of a microscope. A row of three hundred thousand of
them would be required to make an inch in length! Yet
one of these germs can be mature and divide into two new
germs in twenty minutes. In forty minutes there would be
four, in an hour eight, and so on. The number after twenty-four
hours is almost incredible.</p>

<p>These little germs stick to our clothes, fingers, lips,
money, newspapers, and anything that is often handled.
They hover in the air we breathe, permeate the food we
eat, and inhabit water, and especially milk, in enormous
numbers. Some of them are deadly. One might easily
decimate a whole population, as indeed happened in the
South Sea Islands when smallpox was introduced. Others
are harmless and even necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
But to-day if you go into a bacteriological laboratory you
will find hundreds and thousands of little glass tubes all
neatly labelled and stoppered with cotton wool. If you
read those labels you will see that the bacteria of all sorts of
horrible and loathsome diseases have been captured and imprisoned.
There is the deadly anthrax bacillus peacefully
discolouring gelatine; in another, possibly the germs of
hydrophobia may be undergoing a process of taming or
treatment.</p>

<p>Each of these colonies of germs is under perfect control,
and in many of them their natural wickedness has been so
much alleviated that they are now useful aids to the doctor,
who gives his patient a mild dose of the disease in order to
accustom his system to resist accidental infection by the
original type.</p>

<p>Yet what has been done already is only an earnest of
what will no doubt be accomplished. Every farmer and
ploughboy will in time sow his own bacteria; every dairymaid
will make all sorts of cheese, from Camembert, Rochfort,
to Gorgonzola, by sowing the right kind of germ
upon it.</p>

<p>Man will no doubt cultivate the whole earth in the way
that he now cultivates Europe and Great Britain, and will
obtain mastery not only over his domesticated plants and
animals, but over fungi, bacteria, and insects also.</p>

<p>Even if man had never risen above the state of the
Banderlog of Mr. Kipling, there are other animals which
cultivate and even combine together for warfare and conquest.
In some respects they are better disciplined even
than man himself, and they can defy all sorts of mankind
except civilized man.</p>

<p>Possibly if man had not arisen on the scene, these insects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
might have developed some sort of civilization like that
imagined by Mr. Wells in his story of the moon. We are
only concerned with the relations of these ants to plants.
Those who are interested in their conquests and civilization
must consult the excellent account by Mr. Selous in his
<cite>Romance of the Insect World</cite>.</p>

<p>The most interesting points about them are as follows.
They gather a harvest and store it up for the winter. This
habit of the ant was well known to the ancients, and is
mentioned by Solomon. At the time of the French Encyclopædists,
when the fashion of the times was all for destruction
and disbelief, the fact that ants do so was ridiculed
and flatly contradicted, and especially by the great naturalist
Buffon. They pointed out that ants hibernated during
the cold weather, and therefore required no food for the
winter, so that Solomon's story was absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>For nearly a hundred years people forgot that Palestine
and those other countries where the habits of ants had been
reverently observed possessed a climate much too warm and
mild to make the ants hibernate.</p>

<p>After careful study it has been discovered that the ants
thoroughly understand the first stages of brewing!</p>

<p>The corn which they gather is not eaten by them in its
hard winter condition. When taken into the winter nest of
the ants this corn would very soon germinate and grow into
a plant, but the ants manage to prevent this by some
method which is not yet understood. If such a nest is left
alone by the ants, the corn immediately begins to grow, but
it is not allowed to do so till it is required for food. Should
the store of corn get damp by heavy rain, or mould appear
upon it, then the careful ants bring up their store into the
sunlight and dry it there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
When it is required for food germination is permitted,
but is soon stopped: the ants nibble off the growing rootlet
of the seed. Then when the grain absorbs water and begins
to change its starch into sugar, the ants suck in the sugar
and reap the reward of all this labour and skill.</p>

<p>In the conduct of this germination of the grain they are,
of course, far in advance of all the savage races of mankind.</p>

<p>There are certain South American species which go at
least one step farther. They have their own fields&mdash;spaces
three or four feet in diameter&mdash;which are entirely occupied
by one single grass, the so-called Ant-rice (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristida stricta</i>).
Dr. Lincecum states that the ants "work" these plantations
very carefully, removing every weed or other plant that
comes up, and sowing every year the new seed at the proper
season.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>These facts are sufficiently strange and startling, but there
are even, apparently, species still more intelligent, who not
only sow and reap, but actually prepare a soil and reap
a crop of mushrooms, or at least, if not of mushrooms, of
fungi. These wonderful little insects gather leaves and cut
them into fragments of an appropriate size; they are then
collected together so as to form a bed, and the fungus is
introduced to this. The fungus is kept at a certain stage of
growth by very careful treatment; the fruit-bearing ends
are nibbled off, so that the young shoots come up indefinitely.
The ants feed upon these fungus shoots, and get a crop indefinitely
prolonged.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a system of agriculture far beyond that
employed by any tribe of savages. Only man in a relatively
advanced stage of agriculture grows mushrooms for himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
These facts, startling as they may seem, are apparently quite
well authenticated and have not been seriously questioned.</p>

<p>There are a great number of leaf-cutting ants who are,
indeed, amongst the most dangerous of the many insect pests
in South America and elsewhere. Wallace (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Revue Scientifique</i>,
179, p. 29), in speaking of the Saauba or leaf-cutters,
describes how he placed a large heavy branch across the route
of one of their columns.</p>

<p>The long line of laden ants was checked, and the greatest
confusion set in at the head of the column. Each ant, for
several feet down the column, then laid down its leaf, and all
set to work to tunnel under the obstacle. This was managed
in about half an hour's time, and the column then proceeded
on its way.</p>

<p>Amongst other interesting and curious facts connected
with these extraordinary insects is that some kinds are
actually kept up by certain plants as a sort of standing army
or police.</p>

<p>There are no less than 3030 species of plant which keep
these standing armies of ferocious ants, or if they do not
keep them, at any rate lay themselves out to attract them.
The kinds which are attracted live upon sugar, and are
strong, active, and extremely good fighters. When travelling
through the bush in Africa, it is not unusual in some places
to touch inadvertently one of these protected trees. In a
moment one's hand and arm are covered by ants whose heads
are dug deep down into the skin, biting with all their strength.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible to describe all the plants which
protect themselves against injurious insects and even large
animals in this way, but two of them must be mentioned.</p>

<p>There are certain Acacias which are particularly interesting.
Like most of this order, they have large hollow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
spines instead of stipules at the base of the leaf. It is inside
these spines that the troops of the police-insects live.
These Acacias (Oxhorn Acacia, as well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. sphærocephala</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. spadicigera</i>) also produce <em>sugar</em>, which is secreted by
peculiar gland-like organs on the stalks of the leaves, and
even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albuminoids</i>, for at the tips of the leaflets there are
peculiar little bodies which contain albuminous matter.</p>

<p>The Imbauba tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cecropia spp.</i>) also possesses a
standing army of these ants. It puts them up in the hollow
pith in the centre of the tree, which is divided into large
roomy spaces and makes a convenient nest. There is a
minute opening by which they run in and out. On one
occasion a naturalist found that the ants had been benumbed
by a period of very cold weather, and in consequence had
neglected their duty, and the trees had been stripped of their
leaves by leaf-cutting kinds.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>These last mentioned, the leaf-cutting ants, are especially
dreaded by owners of plantations. Foreign or introduced
plants are not specially guarded against their ravages by
special secretions, as is the case with the native flora, so that
the coffee and cocoa plantations are often severely injured.
In some places man has copied those Acacias and
Imbaubas, for in the orange plantations of the province of
Canton, in China, ants' nests are collected and placed on the
trees. Moreover, the different trees are connected together
by bamboos, so that the ants can easily pass, as on a bridge,
from one tree to another.</p>

<p>Near Mantua, in Italy, the same system seems to be adopted,
and ants' nests are carefully placed near the fruit trees.
Their use can be quite well understood, for Forel, in his
work on the Ants of Switzerland, estimates that <em>one ants'</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
<em>nest will require</em> a supply of 100,000 insects a day during the
season.</p>

<p>It is quite common to find ants crawling about on the outside
of the large heads of the Garden Centaury and a few
other Composites. If one looks carefully, one finds that
there are streaks of honey to be seen coming from the scales.
The honey is not produced in the flowers, and seems at first
sight to be of no use at all so far as the plant is concerned,
but that is very far from being the case. Here comes a cockchafer
or other destructive beetle, intent on absolutely
devouring and destroying the young flowers. At once the
pugnacity and wrath of the ants are aroused. They take
up a menacing and ferocious attitude, and the cockchafer
passes to some other plant.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Such honey-glands found on the leaves and not connected
in any way with the flowers, are more common than one
would think. Even the common Bracken produces curious
honey-secreting hairs when it is in a young condition.
These attract ants which drive away caterpillars and other
dangerous insect foes.</p>

<p>Many very dangerous insects are too small for birds, and
can only be dealt with effectually by insects or fungi. Of
these perhaps the most dangerous are the "scale" insects.
The best-known one is very like a minute mussel shell. It is
about one-quarter to one-third of an inch long, and can be
sometimes found in quantities on apples; they are generally
collected round the stalk. The mother insect has this scaly
back, and lies down and dies on the top of her eggs, so that
her scaly corpse forms a roof and a shield for her young
ones. Like all pests of this sort, these creatures increase
very rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
A certain scale insect was doing an immense amount of
harm in the orange plantations of Fiji, but it was destroyed
by the introduction of lady-birds, and of a certain parasitic
fly. It is said that these insects destroyed the "scale" in six
months!</p>

<p>Experiments have also been tried with fungi. There are
certain fungi which attack the bodies of living insects. So
far, however, it cannot be said that the results have been at
all satisfactory, for the propagation and infection of the
living insects by fungus spores is not at all easy. There is
also a certain feeling of doubt as to what may happen.
Those fungi, and particularly bacteria, might set up dangerous
epidemics.</p>

<p>Decaying meal contains hundreds of certain very curious
worms called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nematodes</i>. They are short, about one-twenty-fifth
of an inch in length, and are smooth and
very like minute eels. These creatures are very active,
wriggling or swaying to and fro in a characteristic manner.
Now in decaying meal there is a peculiar fungus. Like
most fungi, it consists of very minute transparent threads
which contain living matter or protoplasm. This particular
fungus has branches, but also forms curious loops
or belts. When one of these eel-worms is swaying about in
the meal, it may quite well happen that its tail slips into one
of these loops. If that happens, the fate of the worm is
sealed, for the loop is elastic, and the more it wriggles the
farther it slips in and the stronger it is held. The fungus
then begins to grow, and forms a tube which grows <em>into the
worm</em> and kills it. All the material in the worm's body goes
to nourish the fungus. This extraordinary fungus has been
described and figured by Professor Zopf, but seems to be a
very unusual and rare form.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE difficulty in describing the Romance of Plant Life
does not arise from a want of romance, but the sieges,
battles, and alarms are so difficult to see, and the
enemies are so tiny, that the terrific contests continually
going on escape our notice altogether.</p>

<p>When one does look carefully and closely at the life of a
plant, one sometimes wonders how it manages to exist at all
in the midst of so many and great dangers.</p>

<p>There are great swarms of insects which devour or burrow
into it, or suck its life-juices. These are infinitely more
dangerous than the relatively clumsy, heavy-footed, grazing
animal.</p>

<p>Every part of a plant has its own special insect foe, and it
is really difficult to understand how it can possibly escape.</p>

<p>Perhaps the "Achilles' heel" is the root, for, underground,
plants get no help from the watchful and ever-present army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
of birds, who are, as we shall see, the natural police of the
world.</p>

<p>The Phylloxera, for instance, which ruined the old and
valuable vineyards in France, is a terrible little acarid, or
mite, which attacks the roots. Too small to see, and impossible
to kill without killing the plant, it laid waste the
fertile hills and valleys of all South and Central France,
causing millions of pounds damage. One reason for this
destruction sprang from the universal sporting instinct
innate in every Frenchman. Everybody goes out with his
gun to destroy any lark, sparrow, or titmouse that is idiotic
enough to remain in the country. Only birds can deal
efficiently with insect pests. Take this horrible little Phylloxera,
for instance; a single female in her life of forty-five
days will lay about two hundred eggs. Each egg becomes a
little grub, which after a few moments of uncertainty and
agitation settles itself, and begins to suck steadily at any
unoccupied part of the vine root. After ten to twelve days'
life it will be laying eggs as rapidly as its mother. Thus in
an ordinary summer the number of young ones produced
from a single female becomes quite incalculable.</p>

<p>These pests are natives of America. Imported on American
roots about 1868, they had in thirteen years practically
ruined the vineyards in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and
Germany.</p>

<p>All sorts of remedies were tried&mdash;saturation of the ground
by poisons, flooding the vineyards to drown them, artificial
cultivation of their insect and plant enemies, and many others.</p>

<p>The correct and satisfactory method has been at last discovered.
American vines of sorts which are able to resist
these Yankee mites have been imported, and the valuable
French vines have been grafted on to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Another very dangerous root-enemy, which is common in
this country, is the Cockchafer grub or Whitegrub. (But it
is not nearly so bad as in France, where in the summer of
1889, a single farmer collected 2000 lb. of Cockchafers.)
The grub (each female lays seventy eggs) burrows into the
earth, and for no less than three summers remains below
ground devouring indiscriminately the roots of everything
he can discover. Underground, the mole is almost his only
enemy, but the rooks, starlings, and gulls, which follow the
plough, are watching for him. The Wireworm, Clickbeetle,
or Skipjack, is also an underground demon which lives for
three years, and gnaws and worries at plant roots for the
whole of that time. It, however, shows itself above the
surface.</p>

<p>A gentleman who had passed his whole life in the country
complained, in my presence, of the damage done by rooks.
He had had six thousand of them shot that summer, and
remarked that he had seen with his own eyes one of them
pulling out a young cabbage plant by the root. Of course it
was quite unnecessary to point out that the poor bird was
merely trying to get at the wireworms and devour them!</p>

<p>For some time I used to look out for great attacks of
wireworm in turnip-fields: when one was recorded, I never
failed to find that the crows had been ruthlessly shot down
a season or two before.</p>

<p>All these, and many other insects, attack the roots, which
would be, one would suppose, quite well protected in the
depths of the earth. Therefore we find roots producing all
sorts of poisonous substances, tannins, and even strong-smelling
bodies, which keep off these pests.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the sucking battalions of the insect army
which do the most harm. In themselves they are weak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
stupid, and scarcely move from their birthplace. They live
out their life wherever their long, lancet-like proboscis
needles have pierced the plant's skin, but it is their power
of multiplication that makes them really formidable.</p>

<p>Huxley calculated that if all the offspring of one "green-fly"
lived, and if their broods also lived for ten generations,
then the tenth brood of that original green-fly would contain
more animal matter than the entire population of
China. Green-fly would, as a matter of fact, go on increasing
at this rate, were it not for the enormous number of
enemies that prey upon them. A mathematical friend of
Mr. Buckton calculated that in 300 days the produce of
a single green-fly might be 210<sup>15</sup>, that is 210 multiplied
by 210, and then again by 210 up to 15 times!</p>

<p>In summer time one may often notice, especially on sycamores
and lime trees, a peculiar shining, sticky, honey-like
substance which covers the leaves. It is often so abundant
as to drip like a rain of honey from the upper branches.</p>

<p>This "honey-dew" was a puzzle which greatly intrigued
learned minds in the ancient world. Pliny speaks of it as
the "sweat of heaven" or "saliva of the stars."</p>

<p>In reality, however, it is nothing but the excretions of
hundreds of millions of these green-fly or aphides, which
will be found established on the under side of the leaves, where,
moored by their little anchoring talons and with their proboscis
inserted in the fresh green leaf, they are sucking hard
and steadily at the sugary juice. In twenty-four hours it
was observed that a single individual gave forth forty-eight
minute drops of honey.</p>

<p>Bees are very often tempted to collect this honey so
abundantly produced, but this turns their own honey black,
and may even make it poisonous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Plants try to protect themselves against these pests
chiefly by means of sticky or long hairs, by a thick skin, or by
unpleasant tasting or smelling substances. But it is to insects
such as lady-birds and others which devour the green-fly
that they owe a deep debt of gratitude. In particular, there
are certain parasitic insects which lay their eggs in their
bodies. Not only so, but it is known that the eggs of some
other insects are laid <em>in the egg of the green-fly</em>, and in one
instance it has been found that yet another insect laid its
egg in the egg of the parasite!</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting objects in nature are the
buds in which, all neatly packed and stowed away, the young
leaves and flowers remain awaiting the warm breath of
spring. They are most interesting to examine: one finds
series after series of overlapping scales which cover one
another in the most ingenious way. No two are exactly
alike, but each seems to have been moulded exactly to the
proper shape. There is no waste anywhere, no useless expenditure
of material. Very often turpentine or resin or a
sticky gum seals up the joining of the scales. Every possible
precaution seems to have been taken by nature. Neither
rain nor snow can enter a winter bud. Neither can the cold
of winter penetrate to the inside where the baby leaves and
flower petals are cosily and tightly coiled up. But observe in
the very earliest warm days of spring an extraordinary little
insect, which has wakened up after its own winter sleep in
the moss or lichen covering the rough and crannied bark of
an old apple tree. This is the Apple-blossom Weevil, a
beetle only about quarter of an inch in length, but with a
curious snout or proboscis half the length of its body. This
creature proceeds to the bud, and fixing its legs firmly, proceeds
to bore a hole through the scales into the middle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the bud. She then places an egg inside, and goes on to put
an egg in each of fourteen to forty-nine other buds. This
takes a fortnight, and then she dies, probably satisfied that
her duty is fully performed. A little footless, cream-white
maggot develops in the apple-bud, which latter becomes
rusty-coloured and dies away.</p>

<p>Another pest is the Apple-sucker, which lays her eggs
in September on the fine hairs which cover the shoots. As
soon as the weather becomes mild and warm, little grubs
come out of these eggs; they are very small, and their bodies
are almost flat. These tiny flat grubs, as soon as they are
born, hurry off to the nearest buds and slip between their
scales. They remain sucking the rich juices of the apple
blossom until May or June, when they become perfect insects,
and fly away so fat and well-nourished that they can
live until September without feeding.</p>

<p>But those are by no means the only dangers. It is not
till the apple blossom, which has escaped all those perils,
opens in the spring time, after its petals have unfolded in the
warm air and the young apple is already half formed, that
the Codlin Moth begins to attack them. This tiny little
moth is then extremely busy. She lays about fifty eggs,
but only one on each young apple. It is put in the one
weak spot of the apple, just at the top, in the base of the
withered flower. The grub tunnels down to the core and
feeds upon the seeds, which are entirely destroyed. When
it has grown sufficiently, it drives another tunnel straight
outwards to the skin. If the apple is still on the tree, the
caterpillar lets itself down on a long silken thread and
hurries off to hide in any convenient crack or crevice of the
bark, or if the apple is already stored away, it conceals itself
in the walls or in the flooring of the loft. The moths come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
out at the end of next May, just when the blossoms are
getting ready for them. These codlin-moth apples cannot
fail to have been noticed by the reader, as the tunnels in the
ripe apple are most conspicuous. The gradual fattening of
the caterpillar can also be traced, for its first tunnel down to
the seeds is quite narrow, while the way out gets wider and
wider as the creature became stouter and fatter whilst
eating its way through the flesh.</p>

<p>The Pear Midge attacks at the same place, but the mother
insect has a long egg-laying tube, and puts from fifteen to
thirty eggs into the opening pear blossom. The pears go on
growing, but of course are quite spoilt by the maggots
within. These latter have a curious springing or jumping
habit, and when they reach the soil bury themselves an inch
or two below the surface.</p>

<p>So that all the care and neatness with which the young
flowers and buds are packed up goes for nothing, and these
insect pests get all the benefits of the apple and pear!</p>

<p>Besides these, there are hundreds of sorts of caterpillars
which devour the leaves bodily. Cabbage-white butterflies,
magpie-moths, gipsy-moths, diamondback-moths, and others,
lay their eggs in hundreds. Many lay 300 eggs each.</p>

<p>In the United States, somebody had sent an entomologist
a present of some eggs of one of these moths. They were
placed on a paper near a window which happened to be open;
the entomologist went out, and the paper must have blown
across the street into a garden on the other side. At any
rate, two or three years afterwards it was found that some
trees were badly attacked by this moth. Nobody thought
much about this, though of course it was interesting to find
a new moth. But the pest became a very serious one. In
consequence of the stimulating air of the United States the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
moth multiplied with the most extraordinary rapidity, and
it is said that about 300,000 dollars was spent in one year in
the attempt to stamp it out.</p>

<p>All this happened because an entomologist forgot to lock
up his eggs when he went away for half an hour!</p>

<p>These caterpillars and the locusts devour the leaves bodily,
but there are others which live inside them. These so-called
"leaf-miner" caterpillars make white irregularly-winding
tunnels between the upper and the lower skin of the leaf.
The tunnel increases or widens because the caterpillar itself
grows fatter as it eats its tunnel. They can be seen on a
great many leaves, and can be at once recognized by this
peculiarity.</p>

<p>Plants cannot run away from their enemies like animals,
and it would seem at first sight that their case was very
hopeless. But it is not so, for there is a vast, active, keen-eyed,
and eager army of helpers always ready for eggs and
caterpillars.</p>

<p>It is birds that are of the greatest importance. A titmouse
will eat 200,000 insects in a season. A starling has
been seen to fetch food for its young ones from a grass
paddock 100 yards away no less than eighteen times in a
quarter of an hour. All the following are excellent birds,
and without a stain upon their characters: the plover,
partridge, robin, wagtail, starling. Crows and wood-pigeons
are under suspicion, for though the latter do good
in devouring the seeds of weeds, and the former in destroying
wireworms, both are fond of corn and take large quantities
of it.</p>

<p>Thrushes, mavises, and blackbirds are amongst the most
persevering and useful of our friends, but they are certainly
fond of fruit. Yet the good which they do is very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
more than any possible harm which an injudicious indulgence
in the juicy fruits of summer might bring about.</p>

<p>The sparrow cannot be given a character. Indeed, he is
objectionable in every way, for he not only does no good
himself, but he devours corn and drives away starlings and
other valuable and interesting helpers.</p>

<p>But it is very difficult to say what will happen if man
interferes with the regular working of Nature. The starling
has been a pest in Australia, though here it does nothing
but good work. We are still grossly ignorant of many
simple but very important facts. Even when we do know
something, as for instance, that the peewit's or plover's
whole life is occupied in clearing the ground of wireworm,
daddy-long-legs grub, insects' eggs, and the like, that does
not help the bird in the least. Plovers' eggs are regularly
sold in enormous quantities. Every farm-labourer collects
them, and the farmer never dreams of interfering.</p>

<p>Man shoots down owls, kestrels, hawks, who prey upon
mice, voles, and sparrows. Then, when some farmers are
half ruined, he has Royal Commissions to find out why the
voles have increased so much.</p>

<p>There are one or two peculiar contrivances found in plants
which are intended to keep off insects, and which may be
noticed here.</p>

<p>Thus, the importance of a moat (which almost always
formed part of the defence of a medieval castle) had been
already found out by one or two plants.</p>

<p>In a particular kind of Teazle and in a large Sunflower-like
Composite (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Silphium laciniatum</i>) every pair of two
opposite leaves run together, so that a little cup-like hollow
is formed surrounding the stem, in which water collects.
Insects climbing up the stem and trying to get at the heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
of flowers fall in and get drowned in this water; their bodies
may be seen floating about in it, and probably when these
decay, their decay-products are of some use to the plant.</p>

<p>This curious contrivance is only a development of a very
common arrangement. In most leaves you will find that
rainwater is intended to run in a particular direction.
There are little grooves and canals down which it is supposed
to go, and dry, thirsty hairs may be found so arranged
as to intercept part of it. Thus in summer the plants are
not confined entirely to the water from the ground, but
are also refreshed by the rain from above.</p>

<p>But if you look closely along these little channels, and
especially at the base of the leaf where they join the stem,
you will find that dust particles washed down by the rain
collect and form little streaks and patches. The air is full
of all sorts of dust particles which are made up of every
conceivable substance. Many of these minute grains of dust
will be dissolved in the water, and help to supply the plant
with food. Nor is that all, for if you take a hand-lens and
examine these dust particles very closely, you will very
probably find small animalcula moving about. They are
not pretty; in fact they are quite horrible to look at.
These are tiny mites which live in these places. Their
office is probably to eat up everything eatable (including
eggs of insects and spores of fungi), and their excreta as well
as their own bodies will probably be dissolved in the water
and go to help the plants.</p>

<p>The most certain place to find them is on the leaves of
the lime and other trees in August. On the under side of
the leaf little bushes of hairs can be found just where the
veins fork. It is necessary to take a pin and stir up these
hairs to frighten them out, but when this has been done, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
lens will show the disgusting-looking little creatures running
hurriedly away. They are no doubt exceedingly annoyed at
being disturbed in the midst of their sleep, for they come
out and forage for anything eatable at night, retiring for
the day into these hairy grottos. The structure of these
grottos is very complicated. They are often like little caves
with a narrow entrance, and the sleeping chamber is quite
within the leaf.</p>

<p>A great many trees have these curious mite homes. The
insects are generally the colour of the hairs, and are not
easy to distinguish.</p>

<p>All those insects mentioned here have so arranged their
life histories that they come into existence exactly at the
proper season. The warmth of the sun, which opens the
apple buds ever so slightly, stirs also the egg of the mite,
the egg of the beetle, or the hibernating weevil, so that all
these insect populations come into full active life just when
they can do the most damage.</p>

<p>But one must not stop there; the bird population is also
ready, and is building its nests and feeding its young, just so
soon as the insect swarms are at their thickest and most
dangerous stage.</p>

<p>Man walks clumsily through this intricate tangle of living
plants and animals: he sets his big foot on a hedgehog
(good for the insects), or on a mole (so much the better for
wireworm), collects plovers' eggs (to the great help of every
insect), shoots an owl (to the delight of voles and mice) or
a whole brood of partridges, and in other ways makes a&mdash;&mdash; we
had better say, shows that he is not so clever as he
supposes himself to be.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>UPPOSING that in China or Japan you meet a native
who shows the following symptoms:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Eyes hollow and surrounded by a bluish margin;
(2) pupils much dilated; (3) with a stupid appearance;
(4) with an emaciated body; (5) of unsteady and staggering
walk; (6) with a dreamy disposition;&mdash;then, you may
be sure that he is an opium-smoker. In some of the Chinese
provinces every man smokes ·03 to ·07 ounce of opium daily,
but those who indulge to excess consume ·3 or even ·6
ounce. It is an excellent medicine when employed in a lawful
and justifiable manner, for it calms the spirits and makes
one sleep. But its use is <em>always</em> dangerous, even when employed
in very small quantity, as in laudanum and morphia.</p>

<p>In the Fen country in England there used to be a very
large sale of laudanum pills which keep off asthma and
rheumatism, but even there it is a dangerous remedy, for it is
only too easy to fall under the control of this drug either by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
injection of morphia, or by eating or smoking laudanum or
morphia. De Quincey's <cite>Confessions of an Opium-eater</cite>
and Kipling's <cite>Gate of the Hundred Sorrows</cite> give a lurid
picture of the ruin of body and soul brought about by
opium.</p>

<p>It is produced from the heads of the Opium Poppy
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papaver somniferum</i>). Any poppy (or indeed any plant of
the Poppy order) when scratched or wounded exudes a thick
white or orange milky fluid. This is called "latex" (or
milk); it is always more or less poisonous, and generally contains
some sort of resinous matter. Thus when the plant is
scratched or pierced, a drop of this milky latex comes out
and at once hardens over the wound. Of course the plant is
much benefited by this, for any destructive insect, unless it
is a confirmed opium-eater, will be poisoned or killed; then
also, if wounds are caused by wind, heavy rain, or animals
passing, the scar is at once healed over and covered by the
hardened opium, so that no dangerous fungus spores can get
in to attack the plant. There is a mildew fungus and also
a smut fungus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Entyloma</i>) which attack the poppy, but both
these enter by the stomata and live between the cells of the
plant.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the Opium Poppy is quite
familiar; its upright stems, large, clasping, bluish-green
leaves and conspicuous flowers may be seen in many gardens.
It is rather interesting, and in many ways; when young, the
buds droop or hang down, and are entirely enclosed in two
large green, hairy sepals. These last are soon thrown off,
and then the flowers open out and display the petals with
their rich black spots, and the crowded mass of stamens
which surround the central greenish head. In bud these
petals are "cramb'd up within the empalement by hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
of little wrinkles or puckers as if three or four fine cambrick
handkerchifs [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>] were thrust into one's pocket," as an old
writer describes it (Grew).</p>

<p>Bees, and especially bumbles, are extremely fond of it, and
even seem to be, in a way, opium-eaters, for they get quite
exalted, almost intoxicated, and above their ordinary laborious
selves. They scurry round and round the flower under
the stamens or hover excitedly above it.</p>

<p>It is at this stage that the opium-gatherer begins his work;
he goes round the beds and collects the petals of the poppy
to use later on (see p. <a href="#Page_304">304</a>). The poppy-heads are then half
grown and bluish-green, but they soon begin to turn yellow
and ripen. When ripe they are most interesting to examine.
There is a large platform covered by a radiating star-like
ornament, which is the stigma. Underneath this is a circle
of little holes just below the crown, but above the head.
Each small hole has a flap. Now if you gather a ripe poppy-head
on a fine dry day all these holes are open, and if you
hold it upright and swing it vigorously from side to side the
tiny seeds come flying out of the holes and will be thrown to
a considerable distance. The stalk is supposed to swing in a
high wind, and the seeds are really slung or thrown out of the
holes. But if, when you come home, you put your poppy-head
in water, or look at the plants in the garden on a very
wet day, you will find that every hole closes or is shut up,
because the small door mentioned above expands so as to
close the opening.</p>

<p>The seeds are only sent out on a fine dry day; but they
travel well. It was observed in America that certain poppies
had been introduced as weeds at a certain place; in fifteen
years they were found twenty-five miles farther on, so that
they were colonizing the country at the rate of three-fifths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
a mile per annum.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The seeds themselves are very light and are
of some value; they may be eaten like caraway-seed, as comfits,
or crushed to supply an oil for lamps, or used as medicine.
It is said that the value of the seed raised in France was in
one year £170,000. The heads themselves are also valuable
(they are worth 35s. per thousand), and even the dried stalks
and leaves, for they may be used as fodder.</p>

<p>But the real reason why the plant is cultivated in so many
parts of the earth is the great value of the opium obtained
from it. This is gathered in the following curious way. As
soon as the dew has dried off the plant, the cultivator goes
round the beds and scratches every poppy-head with a tool
made up of three knives tied together. That is the time recommended
by Theophrastus, and it is apparently still the
usual time to choose. In the late afternoon, from four to
seven, he comes round again and scrapes off the congealed milk,
which is then worked up into cakes and taken to the factory.</p>

<p>It is prepared by being kneaded, dried, and rubbed until
it is of a pale golden colour.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Finally, it is enclosed in a
mass of poppy petals, sometimes mixed with the fruits of
a kind of dock, and is then ready for export.</p>

<p>It is cultivated in a great many parts of the world&mdash;Turkey,
Syria, Persia, France, China, the United States,
Germany, Queensland, but especially in British India, where
the immense plains at Malwa used to furnish opium worth
about sixty million rupees annually (after deducting all
expenses). This was mostly exported to China, and
amounted to a tax of about threepence per head on
every Chinaman; it was also sufficient to defray about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
one-sixteenth part of the expenses of our Indian Empire.
The story of how Great Britain forced China to take our
opium is not a creditable one nor agreeable to read. The
plant was known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and Rome, and
was used in China for at least two hundred years before
our times.</p>

<p>Incisions may be seen in the bark of the tree. The rubber milk runs out from these
into the vessel held in the man's hand.</p>
</div></div>

<p>What is supposed to be the original wild plant from which
the opium poppy was derived seems to have been cultivated
in the ancient Swiss lake dwellings, for the seeds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papaver
setigerum</i> occur there in abundance. The price of the crop
may amount to £90 or £120 per acre.</p>

<p>Another very ancient plant is the Hemp, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cannabis sativa</i>.
It was known to Herodotus, who says that "in the country
of the Massagetæ there is a tree bearing a strange produce
which they casting into a fire inhale its fumes on which they
straightway become drunk." It is a tall, rather handsome
annual, with stems from three to fifteen feet high. It is
cultivated all over the world, from the Equator to 60° north
latitude, but for different purposes. In India it is chiefly
for the resin, "haschisch, churrus, bhang." (That was the
drug used by the Count of Monte Cristo.) In Russia it is
for the seed and the fibre that the plant is cultivated, and
in France, Italy, and Austria the fibre seems to be the most
important product.</p>

<p>Some of the plants produce only stamens or male flowers.
The fibre given by these is stronger and more tenacious than
that of the female plant, which, however, is finer and more
supple. The fibre obtained from the cold northern districts
of Russia is said to be the strongest of all.</p>

<p>The preparation of the fibre is a long, tedious, and
laborious operation. It is also unhealthy, for the fibre
has to be "retted" (steeped in water so that the soft parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
decay), "scotched" (that is the hard wood must be broken
and removed), and "heckled."</p>

<p>This last process is familiar to all who are interested in
political matters. It consists of being drawn on hard points
difficult to traverse and of a very fine and sharp character!
Hemp is the commonest fibre for string, rope, etc.; it used
to be employed for sailmaking by the Romans. Catherine
de' Medici is said to have had two chemises made of hemp.</p>

<p>Hempseed is much appreciated by poultry and birds of all
kinds (which makes both harvesting and sowing rather difficult);
but the chief use of the seed is to furnish a fatty oil
used for soft soap, lighting, and painting. The remains,
after taking the oil, are employed as a cattle food, but it
does not form a satisfactory cake.</p>

<p>The chief interest of hemp is, however, the drug that is
made from the resinous juice. No doubt this has the effect
of keeping off dangerous insects, for it is said that plants of
hemp even keep off insects from other plants planted close
beside them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the leaves and stalks are dried in order to
make the drug "bhang." Many allusions to this substance
are found in Eastern poetry, where it is called the "Leaf of
Delusion," "Increaser of Pleasure," and "Cementer of Friendship,"
but madness is the result of addiction to its use.</p>

<p>The resin is collected by making the labourers put on
leather aprons, and then run up and down vigorously
through the hempfields. The resin is then scraped off the
leather, or off their skins if they prefer to do without
leather. It is either eaten or smoked. Burton describes
how at every cottage door in East Africa the Arabs may be
seen smoking bhang with or without tobacco. "It produces
a violent cough ending in a kind of scream after a few long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
puffs." In small doses haschisch (resin) has pleasant effects,
for people experience pleasant illusions, good appetite, excitement,
and laughter, followed, however, after an interval
by stupor and sleep.</p>

<p>People addicted to the use of haschisch roll their eyes
violently, and have a wild, startled appearance.</p>

<p>Naturally so dangerous a drug cannot be recommended
unless under the most exceptional circumstances, but it is
employed in cases of asthma and insomnia. Haschisch and
opium are the two great curses of the Chinese, Malays, and
the inhabitants of British India and the East. They may
be compared to "drink" in this country, but they are
important medicines.</p>

<p>Among the most curious and interesting facts in Nature
is the extraordinary variety of the ways in which at present
gutta-percha and india-rubber are employed. We should
not be able to ride bicycles, or in motor-cars; we could not
use Atlantic cables and many electrical apparatus; our
railway carriages would be most uncomfortable; golf would
be impossible; we should have no waterproof coats and no
goloshes [sic], if it were not for these valuable and extraordinary
substances, india-rubber or caoutchouc, and gutta-percha.</p>

<p>Their history is full of romance, but perhaps the most
striking part of it is just this fact. Because a few (only a
very few) plants found it necessary to protect their wood from
burrowing beetles by a specially poisonous and elastic substance,
<em>therefore</em> we can play golf and enjoy free-wheel
bicycles.</p>

<p>The rubber is derived from the resinous latex or milky
juice, which pours out from any wound in the bark of certain
trees and creeping plants. This milk must be poisonous
enough to kill the rash and intrusive mother beetle, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
wishes to lay her eggs in the wood. It must be elastic, because
the branches and stems swaying to and fro in the wind require
a yielding, springy substance, but resin is contained in it, so
that it promptly hardens and closes up the scar. The
traveller Belt, in his <cite>Naturalist in Nicaragua</cite>, mentions that
those trees which had been entirely drained of their rubber
by the Indian gatherers were riddled by beetles, and in an
unhealthy, dying condition.</p>

<p>Almost all the important rubber plants are found in wet,
unhealthy, tropical forests; they are by far the most important
jungle product in West Africa, as well as on the Congo
River and in the Amazon valley.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to describe the various rubber trees,
and the different methods of gathering rubber, but it may be
interesting to quote from an account of the method of its
collection in Nicaragua, by Mr. Rowland W. Cater.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The best season for tapping the trees of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castilloa elastica</i>
is from August to February. It is best also to perform the
operation early in the morning before the daily rain, "or in
the evening after the rain has fallen. The milk ... is
white and of the consistency of cream. The tree thrives best
in moist but not marshy forests.</p>

<p>"It seeds in the tenth year, and ought not to be tapped
before its eighth year, or its growth may be much retarded.</p>

<p>"On reaching the group of trees, which numbered seventeen
of various sizes, my Carib friends first cut away the twining
creepers that almost hid the trunks, and then carefully removed
a couple of buruchas, natural ropes of rubber, formed
in the following manner: From incisions in the bark, possibly
caused by woodpeckers or some insect, the juice often exudes,
trickling down the trunk, in and out of the encircling creepers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
and sometimes reaching the ground. The milky stream
coagulates and turns black as it runs, forming a long strip or
cord, with which the huléros often tie up their bales.</p>

<p>"The parasites removed, Pete and José strapped on their
espuelas (climbing spurs), fastened at the knee and ankle,
and having dug a small pit or basin at the foot of each of a
couple of trees, passed a ring of stout rope round the trunks
and their own waists, and walked up with their machetes
between their teeth. By lifting the rope at every step they
were enabled to stand almost erect, and when lying back in
the ring both hands were at liberty.</p>

<p>"José, whom I watched closely, commenced operations immediately
below the first branch. With his broad-bladed
sword he cut in the bark a horizontal canal which almost
encircled the trunk and terminated in a V-shaped angle.
From the point of the V downwards he next cut a perpendicular
canal about two feet in length, which joined another
horizontal channel ending in a V, and so on to the ground.
In the last cut he inserted a large green leaf to serve as a
funnel and guide the milk into the basin.</p>

<p>"The Brazilian rubber collectors always place a receptacle
of tin or earthenware in the hole at the foot of the tree to
prevent the admixture of grit or other foreign matters; they
also strain the milk through coarse muslin; hence the
greater value of Pará rubber. But Nicaraguan methods are
primitive."</p>

<p>In the Congo Free State the taxes are paid by the
collection of rubber. It is alleged that "if the demands for
rubber or other produce were not satisfied, the people at
fault were flogged often most barbarously with a thong of
twisted hippopotamus hide, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chicotta</i>. Or else the
natives were told to catch the women from the offending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
villages, who were brought to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chef de Poste</i> and imprisoned
by him as hostages for the industry of their husbands. Or
else the sentries shot some of the defaulters as examples to
the rest. Frequently there were armed expeditions into
refractory districts and widespread promiscuous slaughter.
The cannibal soldiers of the State or of the Company sometimes
feasting on the bodies of the slain."<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The supply of rubber has of recent years shown signs of
becoming exhausted. As time goes on the Indians of the
Amazon and Orinoco must every year travel deeper into the
inaccessible forests of the Amazon, Orinoco, or in Nicaragua.
Every year also makes it more difficult for the Malagasy in
Madagascar, or the Negroes in West Africa and the Congo,
to gather sufficient rubber for the world's ever-growing
needs. Liberia, the Negro Republic, is said still to possess
plenty of rubber; but it is probable that the true solution of
the difficulty will be found in the plantation of rubber trees.
The exports from Madagascar in 1903 were valued at
2,585,000 francs; from Brazil, £9,700,000; from Nicaragua,
400,000 gold pesos (twelve pesos to the £); from the
Congo, 47,000,000 francs; but even then about 85,000
rupees worth of rubber was exported from plantations in
Ceylon. Unfortunately the trees do not begin to yield until
they are eight years old, but the estimated profit per acre
is very high, at least according to some authorities, who
give a yield of £88 per acre (in Nicaragua).</p>

<p>One cannot help hoping that this will be the case.
When one thinks, e.g., of the Uachins in the forests at the
head of Namkong, who spend forty days in carrying their
rubber on men's shoulders across the mountains to Assam, or
of the horrible stories of the Congo Free State, plantation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
seems decidedly a more satisfactory method of supplying us
with golf balls and bicycle tyres.</p>

<p>The first account of india-rubber is found in Herrera
(Columbus's second voyage), who describes the way in which
the natives play "with great dexterity and nimbleness."
"They struck balls with any part of their bodies."</p>

<p>Juan de Torquemada in 1615 gives quite a good description
of the Castilloa rubber:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The tree is held in great estimation, and grows in a hot
country. It is not a very high tree: the leaves are round
and of an ashy colour: it yields a white milky substance,
thick and gummy and in great abundance. It is wounded
with axe or cutlass, and from the wound the liquid drops
into calabashes: Indians who have got no calabashes smear
their bodies over with it (for nature is never without a resource),
and when it becomes dry remove the whole incrustation."<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The first patent for waterproofing seems to have been
granted in 1791. A Charles Macintosh invented the garment
named after him in 1823.</p>

<p>Very little of the commercial rubber is obtained from the
common india-rubber Fig (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ficus elasticus</i>) which we commonly
grow indoors. This is one of those species of the
Fig family which are generally found growing on the
branches or trunks of other trees, though their own roots
crawl down the trunk of the support to the ground. Once
these roots have reached the ground, they take firm hold and
grow so large and thick that they may be able to hold up the
Fig tree even if the original support decays and crumbles
away.</p>

<p>The gutta-percha which we use comes chiefly from Singapore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
which is a sort of world's market for rubber. There
are a great many different varieties and substitutes of this
substance, but the best kinds come from Malaysia, Singapore,
Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. The uses of gutta-percha
and of vulcanite, which is manufactured from it, are very
varied. Thus, it is employed for the soles of boots, door-handles,
pipes, ear-trumpets, buckets, submarine cables, etc.
It is indestructible in sea-water, and does not conduct
electricity.</p>

<p>A very extraordinary exception to the general rule that
latex is highly poisonous, is found in the famous Cow Tree of
Venezuela. This tall tree (it is often 100 feet high) is found
in large forests near Cariaco, on the coast of that country.
Its milk is said to closely resemble ordinary milk in taste,
and to be perfectly wholesome and nutritious, but it is
rather sticky. This tree was responsible for all sorts of
curious and extraordinary legends in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.</p>

Robin-run-the-Hedge (Goosegrass, Cleavers, or Sticky Willie,
for it is known by all these nicknames as well as by its
proper name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galium aparine</i>).</p>

<p>Its stem is exceedingly weak, but it will be found sometimes
to be six or seven feet long. It does not support itself, but
is resting amongst and entangled in the outer twigs of the
hedge in such a manner that it cannot be blown away by the
wind or indeed picked out without its being broken. The
young stems grow upright and are vigorous at first, but soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
they cannot bear their own weight, and fall back upon a
branch of the hedge. There are small curved little roughnesses
along the stem and on the under side of the leaves of
the Galium; these hitch on to the twig. Up to this point then
the stem is supported, and the young part above grows until
it also gets a lodgment, and so it goes on until it sometimes
reaches right over the top of the hedge.</p>

<p>Its young flowering branches grow out towards the light
away from the main stem, and the yellow withered stem in
autumn rests upon the hedge just as a piece of string laid
upon it might do.</p>

<p>The Bramble and Rose manage to get a support in very
much the same way, but in Great Britain the Bramble
generally grows in open ground and its branches take
root.</p>

<p>The peculiar, curved-back prickles of the Bramble and its
arching sideways growth would of course hang it on to any
horizontal branches in the neighbourhood. Kerner measured
the length of the stem of a Bramble which had interwoven
itself into the boughs of a tree, and found that it was over
twenty feet long, although it was only one-third of an inch
thick. In Chile one often finds hedges of Brambles ten to
fifteen feet in height, which have been formed by the aid of
other plants, and also by the way in which the branches
become entangled with one another.</p>

<p>Some Climbing Roses act in a very similar way, especially
if grown on trellis, but the flower shoots always turn to the
light like those of the Galium.</p>

<p>But it is the creepers and lianes of the tropical forests
that are the most remarkable of all climbing plants. They
twine round the stems and hang in great loops and grotesque
folds from the branches. Sometimes in the dense shade it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
may be difficult to see the main stem, for it is quite thin,
though as strong as a piece of steel wire. It often happens,
when hurrying through a rather open part of the forest
after game, that one's leg suddenly catches in a thin, spiny,
wiry stem of Smilax or some such creeper. The first that
one knows of the creeper is when a quarter of an inch of the
spine is buried in one's flesh.</p>

<p>Away up amongst the branches and foliage far above one's
head, leaves and flowers are developed on numerous branches
which have vigorously pushed out as soon as they got near
the sunlight, this tough, spiny, thread-like stem being
their only connexion with the ground.</p>

<p>The development of these climbing plants is probably
connected with the dense shade of forests. In such places
a young stem growing up will become long and drawn out;
its tip will droop over and hang downwards. But there is a
curious peculiarity in the growth of all stems. The stem
generally grows more rapidly at any one time on one side,
say on the north, and therefore bends over to the opposite
side. After a time it will be growing most rapidly on the
eastern side and then its head points westwards, and so on.
The result is that the tip of the stem swings in an irregular
circle round the stem itself. Its head turns to every point
of the compass in succession. Supposing a stone is tied to
the end of a piece of string, and one swings the stone
horizontally in a circle, then, if an upright stick is put in
the ground and the string comes against it, the string will
coil itself round the stick because the stone goes on swinging
horizontally.</p>

<p>Our young climbing plant in the shade of the forest acts
in exactly the same way. If there is any trunk of a suitable
size, it will in the course of its revolving or sweeping round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
first touch and then coil itself round and round the trunk.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Of these twining stems, one of the most interesting and
beautiful is the common Hop. The young shoots or suckers
which come from the ground may be seen waving their
stems helplessly round in the air. If they cannot find something
to cling to, then they form weak limp curves, but if
one such shoot touches a pole it very soon obtains a hold,
wraps itself round the support, and easily climbs up to
a height of many feet. But the Hop is worth examining
closely. If one passes the fingers along the stem, it feels
rough and prickly. With the aid of a hand-lens, a whole
series of most exquisite little hooks will be discovered. They
are like small pimples with two or three very fine and minute,
sharp grappling-hooks on the top. These prevent the stem
from slipping off. It is also helped in climbing by its
leaves, which curve outwards, and are also provided with
grappling prickles on the under side. At the top of the
stem the young leaves are close together, and folded near the
point, so as not to interfere with the tip finding its way in
and out of a trellis-work or amongst branches.</p>

<p>These grappling-hooks on the Hop are as perfect in their
way, though by no means so beautiful and elegant as those
which are found in the climbing palm, Desmoncus, so well
described by Kerner in his <cite>Natural History of Plants</cite>. It is
one of the rotang palms which reach lengths of 600 feet,
though their stem may be no more than 1-1/3 to 2 inches
thick. The leaflets towards the end of the leaf are transformed
into strong spiny barbs which are exquisitely adapted
to hang on to other plants. In many places, thickets in
which these rotang palms have developed are so matted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
tangled together that it is quite impossible even to cut into
them, and they are practically impenetrable.</p>

<p>Some of our common British twiners climb very quickly.
A complete turn round the supporting pole was made in
England, at Charles Darwin's home, in the following times.
The Hop took 2 hrs. 8 mins., Wistaria 2 hrs. 5 mins., Convolvulus
1 hr. 42 mins., and Phaseolus 1 hr. 54 mins. A
Honeysuckle took 7 hrs. 30 mins. to make one complete turn
round the support.</p>

<p>Recently Miss Elizabeth A. Simons timed the rate of
growth of the same plants at the University of Pennsylvania.
They seem to have been stimulated by the exhilarating
atmosphere of the United States, for they were all growing
faster. The Hop did its turn in 1 hr. 5 mins., Phaseolus
took from 1 hr. to 1 hr. 20 mins., Convolvulus 57 mins.
only, Lonicera from 1 hr. 43 mins. to 2 hrs. 48 mins., and
Wistaria 2 hrs.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> But there are curious variations in the
rate at which these plants revolve.</p>

<p>Thus when coming towards the light they go as fast as
they can, but revolve more slowly, and as it were reluctantly,
away from it. It has been found in one case that
the shoot took thirty-five minutes to do the semicircle
towards the light, and an hour and fifteen to twenty minutes
going away from it, but this is not always the case, for
sometimes the reverse takes place<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> (Baranetzki).</p>

<p>These twining plants are not very common in Great
Britain, and indeed in Europe. Some of them move or
twine to the right (in the same direction as the hands of
a watch or of the sun), such as Convolvulus (Bindweed),
Phaseolus, Ipom&oelig;a, and Aristolochia. Others, like the Hop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Polygonum, Convolvulus, Honeysuckle, and Elephant's Foot,
move in the opposite way from right to left, or "widder-shins."
But there is nothing very important in this distinction,
for the Bittersweet may be found twining in either
direction, and in some plants part of a stem may be twining
one way and the other in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It is in the tropics, and especially in the rank, dark,
moisture-laden atmosphere of the coast jungle forests, that
these twiners attain their greatest development.</p>

<p>They show the most extraordinary variety. Sometimes
a twiner hangs in elegant festoons from branch to branch,
forming a convenient suspension bridge for monkeys. Sometimes
four or five are wound round one another or twisted
together, so that they look like some gigantic cable. In
other cases they are knotted, looped, tangled, and twisted in
the most inextricable manner.</p>

<p>Some creepers are flat, like green ribbons or broad
bands. In others the dense mass of old, thick creepers and
twiners round some sturdy trunk becomes so thick and so
fused together that when the trunk dies the lattice-like
arrangement of these creepers may keep them upright
although the original supporting trunk is quite rotten and
decayed away.</p>

<p>More usually, a tree will become unhealthy because its
branches are overladen with the dense foliage and flowers of
heavy lianes, and because both trunk and branches are so
strangled in the embrace of great creepers that they cannot
expand and develop in the proper way. Then a storm will
overthrow the dead giant of the forest, and these creepers,
entangled with all the surrounding trees, will produce ruin
and destruction all around.</p>

<p>A regular duty of the foresters in India is to cut the stems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
of climbing plants. These twining, trailing, rope-like creepers
are, in fact, natural ropes, and are used as such in India,
Burma, and other places. Sometimes they form natural
bridges of living plants extending across a stream. The
great suspension bridges in the valleys of the Himalayas are
sometimes made without a single nail or plank. They are
just three ropes (one for the feet and two to hold on by)
made of jungle creepers. Crossing one of these swinging,
swaying creeper-bridges is not an easy matter for those whose
heads are unaccustomed to depths of hundreds of feet below
them, especially if combined with a motion of the creeper-bridge
sufficient in itself to produce violent seasickness. Yet
the natives run across them with loads on their heads!</p>

<p>But it is not necessary to go to the tropics to find
interesting and ingenious climbing plants.</p>

<p>There is a very common little British plant, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stellaria
holostea</i> (the Star of Bethlehem, Great Starwort, or Stitchwort),
which is common in shady places, light woods, and by
hedges. In the spring it grows very quickly, and the pairs
of leaves are shut together over the growing point, so that
the end of the stem is narrow and can insert itself between
the leaves and twigs of the neighbouring plants. As soon
as such a growing end gets out of the foliage into the light,
each pair of leaves opens out and curves backwards, making
a pair of broad, curved hooks excellently suited to hang the
stem on to the leaves or twigs. Then another period of
growth follows, and again a new pair of hook-like leaves
opens out. The stem may be five or six feet long.</p>

<p>In a rather rare Speedwell (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veronica scutellata</i>) a very
similar method is used, but the leaves have special little
backward-pointing teeth on their edges which assist in the
attachment process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
But these leaves are not to be compared as regards perfection
of mechanism with the tendrils by means of which plants
climb. These tendrils are thin, flexible, twining threads,
which may be formed by the modification of whole leaves,
in other cases of leaflets, or sometimes of branches. Sweet
Peas, Vetches, Passion-flowers, Vines, and many other plants
possess them.</p>

<p>They are like twining plants in the way in which they
revolve or twine so as to wrap themselves round anything
which they touch. They move much faster than twining
plants. A Cobæa tendril only takes twenty-five minutes to
make a complete turn, Passion-flowers take from half to
three-quarters of an hour, and the Vine tendril takes a little
over an hour to make one complete turn.</p>

<p>But in one way they differ altogether, for they are sensitive
to contact. If tickled, they contract and embrace closely
the object which is touching them. They show a most
extraordinary sensibility and sensitiveness.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these tendrils have a finer sense of
touch and a much more delicate feeling of weight than any
human being. They detect the weight of twenty-seven
inches of a spider's thread.</p>

<p>It is, however, best to explain what happens. A half-grown
curved tendril of the Passion-flower is perhaps the
most interesting to experiment with, but any sort of tendril
does quite well. If one very gently rubs the inner or concave
side of its little hook, then in a very few minutes, or even
seconds, the tendril distinctly curves. If this has happened
naturally, as when for instance it has been rubbing upon a
pea-stick, this curve makes it curl round the stick, and the
more it touches the more it curls, until the whole tendril is
wrapped round the support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
It is, of course, quite impossible to explain it all exactly:
the sensitive part on the inside of the curve differs from the
outside or convex part of the tendril; the former has a layer
of elongated, thin-walled cells, full of the living matter, protoplasm,
which are absent on the outer side. Immediately
the tendril touches the stick, the outer convex surface begins
to grow rapidly. It grows from forty to 200 times as fast as
the inner side which touches the stick! Very soon after it
has clasped the stick the tendril becomes woody and forms a
strong, woody, spiral coil.</p>

<p>These tendrils can be made to curve by a weight exceedingly
small. The most sensitive part of our own skins is
quite unable to distinguish so small a weight as is perceived
by these tendrils. Even the sensation of taste can only be
produced by a weight eight times as great as that shown by
some of them. Tendrils curve very quickly after they have
been touched. In twenty seconds some tendrils curve
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclanthera</i>), others (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passiflora</i>) take thirty seconds, and
some of them require four to five minutes or even longer
before they make up their minds to coil.</p>

<p>Even more remarkable, however, is the fact that they do
not coil when raindrops fall on them, giving a much harder
blow than small weights. If one tendril touches or rubs
against another, it is said not to curve. They are persevering
little things also, for Darwin got a passion-flower tendril
to curve when struck or rubbed no less than twenty-one
times during fifty-four hours.</p>

<p>If one reflects on all these curious facts, it is difficult to
help feeling that these plants behave very much in the way
that a reasonable animal would do. There are many other
cases in which some vegetable does exactly what we should
expect of reasonable beings under the circumstances. The tip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
of the root (see p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>), the Sensitive Plant, the Monkey
and Barberry flowers, are all well-known cases.</p>

<p>So that it is difficult to find anything in science to contradict
the comfortable belief that wide-open flowers and
stretched-out leaves of plants as they drink in the warm rays
of the sunlight are really enjoying themselves, whilst they
are doing their day's work.</p>

<p>All these interesting facts are so beautifully described and
so carefully summed up by Charles Darwin, that we shall
only earnestly recommend our readers to get first that fascinating
book <cite>The Power of Movement in Plants</cite>, and then
read all the rest of his works.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>There are an extraordinary number of these plants and
the tendrils are formed exactly where they will be most
useful. Every part of a leaf may become a tendril. The
whole leaf is changed into one in some kinds of Lathyrus.
In a very beautiful creeper which is not so often grown in
greenhouses as it might be (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloriosa superba</i>), the tip of the
leaf only acts as a tendril. Leaflets are often made into
tendrils. The Clematis is the most economical of them all,
for the leaf-stalk coils round and forms little woody rings
which hold up the plant.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of tendrils, it may be interesting
to notice the queer corkscrew spirals in which they roll
themselves up. These spirals are formed after the end of the
tendril has tied itself to the support and become woody.
The free part between the end and its own stem goes on
revolving; now if you tie a piece of string at both ends and
make it revolve, you will see at once that it must coil itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
into a double spiral, one part in one direction and the other
in the opposite way, with a flat piece between them.</p>

<p>One might be disposed to think no more about these
double coils; but here comes in one of the curious, inexplicable
coincidences which happen so often in plant life. Such
a coil is much stronger than a straight bit of wire or string
would be, because if pulled out it yields and is springy.
That of course makes it less probable that the tendril will
be broken. Attached by a series of wiry springs, the plant
yields and sways to the wind, and it is not likely that it will
be torn away. Besides this, the coiling of the tendril pulls
the stem closer to its support, which is also a great advantage.</p>

<p>Certain Virginian Creepers and Vines behave in quite a
different manner. The tendrils grow away from the light
and so seek the shadow of the leaves. They are also divided
into little branches. At the tip of each little branch is a
small knob; if this should touch the wall or the trunk of a
tree, etc., it immediately secretes a drop of cement and glues
itself firmly to the wall. There is a curious difference in
different sorts of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ampelopsis</i> in this respect. There is no
adhesive pad in one of them (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ampelopsis hederacea</i>) until it
touches, whilst <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. Veitchii</i> has them more or less ready for
gluing before they touch (though they become much
larger and better developed as soon as they rub against the
wall).<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting of our common climbers, "that
rare old plant the Ivy green," has not yet been mentioned.
It is exceedingly decorative on walls, especially on ruins and
on old tree-trunks in winter time, where its dark, brilliant
green is most effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
A violent controversy rages as to whether it does good or
harm. Unhappily it does not do any good to trees. It
does not suck their sap, for its roots do not get through the
bark, but it does choke, with its clinging branches, young
tree-stems, and prevents their growing properly.</p>

<p>Also, in winter storms an ivy-covered tree is much more
likely to be blown down. But on walls the ivy certainly
does good, for it sucks up the moisture, and ivy-covered
walls are much more dry inside than those which are exposed
to rain.</p>

<p>Its method of climbing is very curious. All along the
stem quantities of little roots are produced. They dislike
light, like most roots, and creep into crevices and cracks,
where they wedge themselves in by growing thicker. Thus
the stem is anchored all along its length. It is curious to
find that these roots are formed before a twig is actually
touching the wall, so as to be ready for any emergencies.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>One interesting little point in the growth of the ivy on a
tree is perhaps worth mentioning. The main stem runs
nearly straight up the trunk, and when young is pulled
down into the crevices or cracks in the bark. But its
branches leave the main stem at an angle of forty-five
degrees or so to it; these latter may often grow in this
direction for a foot or eighteen inches, but then they
gradually begin to turn more and more distinctly up the
tree. Still these branches firmly clasp the trunk like arms
spread out on either side of it, and make it almost impossible
to dislodge the main stem.</p>

<p>Old plants of ivy entirely surround the trunk. The
flowering branches grow straight out into the air, and have
no tendency to cling to the bark. Their leaves are also
different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
The ivy may be considered as a root-climber, although the
branches assist by growing round the stem.</p>

<p>A curious instance has been given me of the longevity of
ivy and its power of clinging to life. A correspondent
mentions the case of a Scotch fir whose life was threatened
by an ivy. The trunk of the ivy was sawn through. That
did not kill it, at any rate immediately!</p>

<p>Probably the rain soaked up by the leaves, and by the roots
in the crevices of the bark, kept it sufficiently fresh to cling
to life. As it refused to die, a ladder was brought, and it
was dragged off the tree. No doubt it would have died if
the weather had been at all dry.</p>

<p>There are some very beautiful tropical plants which also
climb by means of their roots. These roots, the so-called
girdle roots, grow right round the stem and embrace it, so
that the climber is perfectly supported.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be impressed with the extraordinary
variety of all these contrivances by which plants
are able to escape the trouble of supporting themselves.
But such ways of life involve certain disadvantages. Supposing
there is nothing on which to climb, the stems trail
feebly on the ground, and are probably soon choked by the
surrounding grasses. Curiously enough, there are varieties
of the Ivy, Wistaria, and the French Bean which are upright,
and do not climb at all. The Tree Ivy has all its
leaves like the leaves of the flowering shoot in the common
form. In America, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wistaria sinensis</i> is often grown as a
standard tree, and does not send out the long shoots, sometimes
thirty feet in length, which are common when it grows
on walls. The dwarf French Bean has a thick stem and
requires no support, yet it often puts out a long slender
shoot which tries to twine round something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
In a tropical forest also, the creepers, though they damage
the trees, yet manage to find space for their leaves and
flowers: more vegetable matter is formed per square yard of
ground than would be the case if there were no climbing
plants.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE word <em>cannibal</em> is often used in a very loose and
unscientific way. Amongst some savage tribes it is
the custom to eat old people and young children; but
this is only in seasons of famine and scarcity, when there is
no other food available, and not because they are specially
fond of them. But amongst other tribes wars are made for
the special purpose of capturing fat young people to cook.
Sometimes they have become so accustomed to such delicacies
that they are unable to get their food in any other
way. Of course, when tribes become "pure cannibals" of
this last type they have to be destroyed like wild beasts.</p>

<p>Among plants we find all sorts of transitions and degrees
of cannibalism. There are plants which sometimes, and, as
it were, accidentally, attack others. But there are also real
cannibal plants which live entirely on the life-juices and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
sap of other plants, and cannot exist by their own labours
at all. Moreover, we can find almost every conceivable state
of transition. These can be clearly and definitely traced from
those plants which depend on the labour of their own roots
and leaves to others which have no leaves, and which consist
merely of one large flower and a large adhesive sucker
fixed on some one else's root.</p>

<p>The difficulty is very often to know where to draw the
line. Probably no flowering plant is quite independent of
the labour and work of its neighbours. As we have tried to
show in another chapter, a long preliminary cultivation
by bacteria, lichens, and mosses is required before flowering
plants can develop on bare rock. That is also necessary in
all cases where the soil is mineral or <em>inorganic</em>, without any
<em>organic</em> dust or fragments of vegetable or animal matter.
Bacteria must always begin the work by preparing nitrates
and other salts.</p>

<p>So that only those bacteria which weather rocks can be
called really free and independent. But other bacteria, such
as those which cause typhoid, anthrax, hydrophobia, etc.,
are the best possible examples of pure cannibals, or, as they
are usually described, parasites.</p>

<p>This last word is derived from a peculiar class of people
in ancient classical times, who used to appear whenever a
meal was going to begin, and received food without giving
anything in return. They are represented by our tramps or
by the "sundowners" in Australia, who appear as soon as the
evening meal is ready and when there is no possibility of
going any further on their journey.</p>

<p>The way in which plants became parasites or cannibals is
a very interesting part of plant life, and we shall try to
trace some of the various stages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
To begin with, if one looks out for them in spring one is
sure to find a whole series of beautiful spring flowers.
There is the Primrose, with its bright, hardy, yellow flowers;
the Violet, whose strong perfume much annoys the huntsman,
for it spoils the "scent" and shows him that the end of
winter has come; the delicate little Moschatel, the Lesser
Celandine, the Bluebell or Hyacinth, Dog's Mercury, the
Male and the Lady Fern, and many others.</p>

<p>Most of these begin to grow and are in flower early in the
season. That is because they are living on the <em>dead leaves</em>
of the last year, or rather of two or three years ago. Their
roots are breaking up and devouring, with the help of
worms, beetles, and insects, the leaf-mould of past seasons.</p>

<p>They are quite dependent on the trees; they cannot exist
except where such leaf-mould is formed.</p>

<p>But it is very difficult to tell whether these humble little
herbs which live on the scraps that fall from the tall trees
are either parasites or clients, which last do some good in
return for their share.</p>

<p>Probably they are distinctly useful and good for the forest
if this is considered as a whole <em>establishment</em>. They use
light which would otherwise be wasted, and their own dead
leaves increase the annual deposit of leaf-mould.</p>

<p>There are other plants, such as the Bird's-nest (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neottia</i>) and
Coralroot<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Orchids, as well as Monotropa and others, which
also live on the rich, decaying leaf-mould of forests, but
these are generally pale in colour, for they possess but little
green chlorophyll. They are more directly dependent on
the mould and have ceased to do much work for themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Most of them in fact have entered into an alliance with
fungi, and use these fungi to get their food material from
the dead leaves.</p>

<p>Such fungi are always abundant in good, well-grown
forests (see p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>). These Orchids and Monotropa have
their roots and underground stems covered and wrapped
round by the fungus threads, which extend from them in
every direction, breaking up and decomposing the dead
leaves.</p>

<p>The colour of Monotropa is a pale waxen yellow, that of
the others is usually a ghostly pale, opalescent, steel-blue or
coral-like hue, which makes them very distinct in the dim,
mysterious shades of the forest.</p>

<p>These plants are undoubtedly of use, for they break up
and decompose the leaf-mould.</p>

<p>Another very interesting group are not well represented
in this country. Sometimes one may see on an old tree a
Gooseberry bush in full foliage quite high up the trunk in
the fork of the branches. In sheltered woody ravines, Polypody
ferns are often established on old moss-clad branches,
where their green fronds hang over to catch as much as they
can of the sunlight. But Orchids, Bromeliads, and Ferns
which grow upon the branches of great trees are one of the
most conspicuous and beautiful features of tropical woods.
It is for these tree-orchids that the orchid-hunter braves the
head-hunters of Borneo or traverses the precipices and
rugged forests of Guatemala and Brazil. It is often necessary
to cut down a tall tree in order to get the orchids in its
higher branches. Often, however, this is unsuccessful, for the
tree is so held up by creepers and other giants of the forest
that it never reaches the ground!</p>

<p class="smcap">Cinnamon Peeling in Ceylon</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then, after being stripped from the branches, in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
out-of-the-way forest-clad range of Burma, Celebes, South
America, or Madagascar, these orchids are dried, put up in
crates and packed off to London, where they are carefully
cultivated in hot-houses and persuaded to flower. They
may be worth sixpence or they may be worth £500 each,
but no one can tell until they have flowered in London.</p>

<p>But the romance of the orchid-hunter is not exactly what
we have to describe here. It is rather the romance of the
life of the orchid itself.</p>

<p>It is perched high up on the branches of the tallest trees
in the forest, exposed to sun, exposed to wind, and quite
unable to gather either salts or rain from the soil. How,
then, does it manage to live?</p>

<p>These orchids, it must be remembered, are only found in
out-of-the-way and feverish, unhealthy places, where the
aboriginal savages still lurk and endure a dreadful existence
of hunger and starvation in dense tropical forests.</p>

<p>Now the word "dense" explains the whole story. Those
forests are so thick, so full of giant trees and exuberant
growth, that civilized man even to-day in 1906 can make
nothing of them, and leaves them to the savage. The
reason why vegetation is so luxuriant is simply that there
are both plentiful moisture and a hot, tropical sun. That
makes the life of the orchid possible, and also ensures
malaria for the hunter.</p>

<p>It hangs out into the moist air long pendulous roots
which act as so many sponges absorbing and soaking in
moisture. The tremendous energy of growth covers bark
and branches with creeping plants innumerable, with a profusion
of moss, liverworts, and ferns such as we cannot
imagine from our own experiences in this country. So the
roots of our orchid find on the branches rich leaf-mould,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
and it lives happily and contentedly on the salts and
moisture accumulated by the mosses and other plants. Its
leaves are fleshy and succulent, rather like those of a desert
plant, so that it can store up water against a season of
drought.</p>

<p>These plants which grow in this way on other plants, do
not, as a rule, greatly injure them, but many have not
stopped at this stage. Take, for instance, the Gooseberry
growing in the fork of an old tree. Some bird has been
eating gooseberries and dropped the seed there. The roots
of the gooseberry will grow down into the rotten part of the
trunk. Earth and leaf-mould will accumulate there, and it
is quite probable that the whole inside of the tree will
decay away. The roots of the gooseberry will, if only indirectly,
help in this decay.</p>

<p>But it is far otherwise with another set of plants&mdash;the
Mistletoe and its allies. There is plenty of romance connected
with the mistletoe. Dr. M. T. Masters says as
follows: "The origin of the modern custom connected with
mistletoe is not very clear. Like many other customs, its
original significance is only guessed at. If known, perhaps,
the innocent merriment now associated with the plant would
be exchanged for a feeling of stern disapproval, and the
mistletoe would be banished from our homes. In such a
case ignorance is bliss."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that all the gods of Iceland were
once gathered together so that a general oath might be
exacted of every plant "that grew upon the earth," that
they would do no harm to Balder the Beautiful. The
Mistletoe did not take the oath, because it does not grow
upon the earth but upon a tree. Then the enemy
fashioned an arrow out of the mistletoe, and killed Balder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
There is a modern idea that the story is a myth representing
the death of Spring, for a great many similar
stories occur in widely distant places.</p>

<p>However, it seems pretty certain that the plant was a
sacred one to the Druids in the time of the Romans.</p>

<p>Ovid speaks of this in the line, "Ad Viscum Druidæ
cantare solebant." At their solemn meetings, which were
held in remote sacred groves, a Druid clad in white robes
cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle. Then, apparently,
human sacrifices were offered and a general festival took
place.</p>

<p>Some remnant of this custom seems to have persisted in
Herefordshire until recent times, for the tune "Hey derry
down, down down derry" (which means <em>in a circle move we
round the oak</em>) is supposed to be a relic of the hymn chanted
by the Druids when they had found mistletoe on the oak.</p>

<p>It was said in the Middle Ages to be a useful cure for
apoplexy, madness, and giddiness. That is not at present
the general view. Indeed, under present conditions it might
conceivably promote the last and even the second of these
disorders, though in an agreeable way!</p>

<p>The Mistletoe and its allies, Loranthus and Arceuthobium,
grow upon the branches of trees like the orchids and
gooseberries already mentioned, but they differ altogether in
having a special kind of absorbing root which sinks down
into the bark until it reaches the wood of the "host" tree.
The sap running up the tree is then tapped by this root,
and goes to supply the mistletoe with water and salts in
solution. It has, however, its own green leaves. Thrushes
eat the berries of the mistletoe; they will be left upon a
branch with the <i>guano</i>; as the latter dries up, the seed is
drawn to the underside of the branch, and sticks in a crack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
or crevice; it then sends the sinker-root mentioned above
into the branch.</p>

<p>Every year afterwards new mistletoe "roots" are formed
which grow through the soft part of the bark and send down
sinkers into the wood. Cases of Mistletoes forty years old
have been recorded. The trees which they prefer are the
Apple, and after that Black Poplar, though mistletoe may
be found on Silver Fir, various Pines, and others. It is
more difficult to get it to grow on the Oak than on any
other tree. Indeed, only seven cases of mistletoe growing on
oak have been recorded in this country.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> It is quite a valuable
crop in some places, and is sent in tons to the London
market.</p>

<p>There are many species of Mistletoe, and at least one kind
attacks, and is parasitic upon, another species of Mistletoe.</p>

<p>Most Mistletoes and Loranthus have their own green
leaves, and only take from the plant to which they are
attached sap and mineral salts. But in Chile there is a
beautiful Loranthus that has practically no green leaves at
all. Its blood-red flowers grow in dense masses upon the
giant Cactus, which is common on the drier hills, and these
are always mistaken for the Cactus's own flowers, which are
quite different. These almost leafless Loranthus, and the
curious Arceuthobium are more parasitic than ordinary
mistletoes, for they obviously take other food material
(probably sugar and albuminoids) from their "host."</p>

<p>Another series of parasites or cannibals are quite common
in Great Britain. One often sees in some meadow that the
grasses are growing in a scanty and unhealthy manner; one
then notices amongst them numbers of the Yellow Rattle or
the Eyebright (which the Germans call <em>Milk-thief</em>). These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
plants are not very remarkable in any way, but if one
examines them closely one sees that the leaves and stems are
more purplish-red than is at all usual with our ordinary
flowering plants. But if you dig up some specimens very
carefully, then the wickedness of the Yellow Rattle and
Eyebright becomes apparent; every here and there upon
their roots are little whitish swellings which are firmly
attached to the roots of other plants (generally of grasses).
These two robber plants send from these swellings minute
sucker-roots which pierce into the grass-root and intercept
the water which the grass has been absorbing for itself.</p>

<p>They are therefore parasites, and indeed they may cause a
considerable loss of forage in a meadow.</p>

<p>A good many other British plants are root thieves.
Besides these two, there are the Cow-wheat, Red Rattles,
Toadflax, Broomrapes, and Toothwort.</p>

<p>A curious point about them is that they differ amongst
themselves in the degree in which they are dependent on the
work of others. Some are able to grow quite well without any
such extraneous help, but the Broomrape and Toothwort are
entirely dependent on others' labours. They have extremely
little chlorophyll and very small leaves, and are clearly
parasites "pure and simple."</p>

<p>There are about 180 species of Broomrape (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orobanche</i>).
All of them attack roots, and most confine their attentions
to one particular flowering plant. Their colours are
generally very striking and unusual. Our British species
are reddish, flesh-coloured, or dirty white, but some of the
foreign kinds are blue or violet, yellow, or yellowish to dark
brown. Generally the seedling Broomrape worms its way
down into the earth till its root-tip touches the root of its
special favourite host, then the root of the Broomrape fixes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
itself for life; its suckers grow into the host and absorb all
the food material which it requires. Those kinds which
attack Tobacco and Hemp are dangerous pests and do considerable
damage.</p>

<p>The Toothwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lathraea</i>) is so called because its scales
have a sort of resemblance to human teeth. With the
curious superstition which prevailed in medieval times, it was
supposed that the plant must be a remedy for toothache
because it resembled teeth. Unfortunately this is not the
case.</p>

<p>It is, generally, quite like the Broomrape in its method of
growth, but it sends out long thread-like branching roots
with suckers on the ends, which become fastened on the
Hazel roots. For several years the plant remains underground
and forms very odd-looking, white, scaly branches.
These scales are rolled back in such a way as to form peculiar
and irregular cavities which open to the outside near the
tip of the leaf. There is no doubt that animalcula of sorts
get into these cavities and probably die there. In that case,
their remains will form a useful supplement to the diet of
the plant. The following remarks, however, taken from
Kerner have been disputed by other botanists.</p>

<p>Certain of the cells lining these cavities "appear to send
out delicate filaments.</p>

<p>"When small animals penetrate into the labyrinthine
chambers of a Lathraea leaf and touch the organs just
described, the protoplasmic filaments are protruded and lay
themselves upon the intruders. They act as prehensile arms
in holding the smaller prey, chiefly Infusoria, and impede the
motion of larger animals so as to cut off their retreat. No
special secretion has been observed to be exuded in the foliar
chambers of Lathraea. But seeing that some time after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
creatures have entered the chambers, the only remains of
them that one meets with are claws, legs, bristles, and little
amorphous lumps, their sarcode-flesh and blood having vanished
and left no trace, we must suppose that the absorption
of nutriment from the dead prey here ensues...."<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>But strange as these Broomrapes and Toothworts may be,
they are quite inconspicuous as compared with the gigantic
parasites found in Sumatra and Java.</p>

<p>In 1818, when Sir Stamford Raffles was making a tour in
the interior of Sumatra, his party came across one of those
extraordinary plants which have been called after him.</p>

<p>Imagine a gigantic flower in shape resembling a very fleshy
forget-me-not, but more than a yard across! The colour is
a livid, fleshy tint, and the smell is like that of a charnel-house.
This extraordinary <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rafflesia Arnoldii</i> is the biggest
flower in the world. It has no proper stems or leaves, but
consists merely of this huge flower-bud attached to the
roots of Figs, etc., which traverse the ground in these
forests. It is said to be only found in places frequented by
elephants, which are supposed to carry its seeds on their feet.</p>

<p>There are four other kinds known: all of them occur in
Sumatra, Java, and other neighbouring islands. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">R. Padma</i>
for example, has a flower about eighteen inches across. The
central part is a dirty blood-red, while the lobes have almost
the colour of the human skin. This also has a "cadaverous
smell, anything but pleasant."</p>

<p>These weird Rafflesias seated on the roots "which wind
about on the dark forest ground" have impressed every
observer.</p>

<p>Yet if one glances back, it is interesting to see how
insensible are the transitional steps which lead from independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
life by the plant's own exertions to these last "pure
parasites," which are entirely dependent on other plants for
everything that they require.</p>

<p>The only other flowering plant which we shall mention in
this chapter is now fortunately very rare in Great Britain.
This is the Dodder, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cuscuta</i>. It belongs to the Convolvulus
or Bindweed order, but is entirely different from the rest of
the family. Some climbing plants do throttle or choke the
trunks of young trees if they twine round them too closely,
but the Dodder has an entirely special and peculiar way of
supporting itself to the detriment of others. It has no
roots, no leaves, and scarcely any green chlorophyll; the
Dodder is just a twining, thread-like, yellowish stem which
carries here and there small round clusters of little convolvulus-like
flowers. Wherever the Dodder thread twines
round a hop or other plant, it puts out small suckers which
drive their way into the stem of the hop and take from it
all the food which the Dodder requires. When well developed
it forms dense yellowish tangles of intricately entwined
threads, which may cover whole bushes and entirely
destroy the supporting plants. The Flax, Clover, and Hop
Dodders are perhaps the worst of them all.</p>

<p>There are some rather interesting points in the history of
the tiny dodder-seedling. It remains, quietly waiting, for
about a month after most other plants have germinated.</p>

<p>Then it begins to grow rapidly: its tip pierces the soil
and becomes fixed in it; then the rest of the little thread-like
seedling begins to curve round or revolve. If it touches
a grass or even a nettle stem, it twines itself or coils round
it, drives in its suckers, and, on the strength of the nourishment
which it extracts, it goes on revolving or turning until
it forms the dense tangled masses referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Then an eruption of flowers appears, from which later on
hundreds of tiny seeds are let loose which will become
Dodders in their turn.</p>

<p>The series of parasitic plants which have now been
mentioned form a very interesting set. It must be pointed
out that those which live merely on dead vegetable matter
are "good" plants. They help on the quick and thorough
employment of worn-out material.</p>

<p>Nor can we say off-hand that other parasites are "bad."
They do kill other plants and do them harm, but then, are
they not like a cattle-breeder who sends his inferior cattle
to the butcher, keeping only those which are the very best of
their kind? Perhaps these plants, by destroying the weak
and unhealthy kinds, are doing a great deal of good.</p>

<p>Another interesting point about such parasites is that
they are generally <em>rare</em>. They must be less common than
their "host." Yet another is that they are all "degenerates."
They show distinct traces of decay and bad development in
their flowers and seed. That is also true in the case of
parasitic animals.</p>

<p>Whether they do good or harm to the world of plants is
doubtful, but there is no doubt that they are doing harm to
their own chances!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="small">PLANTS ATTACKING ANIMALS</span></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the whole the animal world preys upon the vegetable
world, and is in a way parasitic upon it. Indeed,
the connexion between the two is very intimate&mdash;that
of the diner and his dinner. One can scarcely
imagine a more intimate connexion than this!</p>

<p>There are, however, a great many cases in which plants
have turned the tables on their enemies and deliberately laid
themselves out to catch and to destroy, to feed upon and to
devour insects and small animals. One finds a few examples
in almost every group of plants.</p>

<p>Thus there are certain green seaweeds or algæ which are
said to attack and prey upon those peculiar sea-urchins
known as Brittle Stars. The fungus which forms loops,
acting exactly like a poacher's rabbit-snare, in order to catch
mealworms, has been already mentioned.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the summer one may notice a little red club
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
about two to three inches long sticking out of short grass.
If one carefully pulls this up it is found to be growing out
of a dead chrysalis or grub. It is a fungus whose spores
have attacked the caterpillar; they have developed inside its
body, and eventually, having completely eaten up the insect,
form the red club, which is producing hundreds of thousands
of spores intended to attack other caterpillars.</p>

<div><a name="fungus_in_caterpillar" id="fungus_in_caterpillar"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_340.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>The branches like stag's horns are the fruit of a fungus, Cordyceps Taylori,
which lived inside and killed the caterpillar.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An allied fungus forms a peculiar branched fruit rather
like a minute stag's horn, and the caterpillar may be seen
for some time crawling about with this extraordinary fungus
sticking out of its head. Of course the bacteria are, some
of them, by far the most dangerous foes of animals (see
page <a href="#Page_328">328</a>).</p>

<p>Then there is a small Liverwort, a little red, moss-like
plant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frullania tamarisci</i>), which may be found growing on
the bark of trees, which is said to catch animalcula in the
small sack-like leaves which are underneath the ordinary
ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
But it is amongst the higher flowering plants that one
discovers the most extraordinary and purposeful arrangements
for capturing and digesting insects and other creatures.</p>

<p>In the case of many of these insectivorous plants, traps or
pitfalls are prepared for the insect to fall into.</p>

<p>There are many plants in which the rain is intended to
run in one particular direction, and it is not at all uncommon
to find hollows at the base of the leaf where dust,
dirt, and dead insects accumulate. One very curious plant
of this sort is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dischidia Rafflesiana</i>, in which the leaves
have become quite like a pitcher, and have been compared
to "natural flower-pots" intended to hold rain and leaf-mould.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Then there is the Bromelia or Pineapple family, which
consists for the most part of plants which live on the
branches of trees. In very many of these a small cup is
formed in the middle of the rosette or tuft of leaves, and
water collects in this central cup.</p>

<p>The water smells abominably, and contains the bodies of
dead insects, and rubbish of all kinds (see also p. <a href="#Page_298">298</a>). The
remnants of these drowned insects are probably of use,
because any valuable nitrogenous or other material may be
absorbed with the water by the plant and help to nourish
it, but in such a rough contrivance as this there is nothing
comparable to the Side-saddle plant, Pitcher plant, and
others.</p>

<p>The former, Sarracenia (or Side-saddle plant), is a common
and rather widespread North American plant, which is
especially abundant in Florida. It is cultivated in most
botanical gardens, but can only be grown in greenhouses.
The leaves are about six inches to a foot long, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
hollow, funnel-shaped tubes with a short, flat wing along
one edge. They may be an inch or two in diameter at the
top or wider end, where there is also a sort of half-open lid
which keeps rain from getting into the inside of the leaf.
The colour of these tube-like or vase-like leaves varies. It is
often variegated with brown, red, and yellow, and is conspicuous
enough even at a distance. Thus insects fly to
these vases and alight on the little cap or lid, where they
find honey and enjoy themselves. Other insects crawl up
along the rim or wing of the vase, finding honey here and
there along their road. Having got to the lid, the insect,
being of an inquiring or inquisitive disposition, will look
inside the tube and endeavour to find more honey therein.</p>

<p>It reaches the rim of the vase and finds that there is
honey inside; it can easily crawl down, and fails to notice
that the inside of the vase is lined with long stiff points
which all point downwards. These points or hairs do not at
all interfere with its passage down, and it proceeds to the
honey which forms a smooth, slippery coating. Then, after
greedily absorbing the honey, it tries to get out again.
But that is quite a different matter. Each one of these
points or hairs is facing it, and the whole inside is smooth
and slippery. It struggles, slips, and falls into a pool of
water which fills the lower part of the vase. That is what
the plant has developed these pitchers for. The body of the
insect after a time decays away, and only its empty shell
remains. An extraordinary number of insects are caught by
these Sarracenia vases. Sometimes in one which is only ten
inches long, three or four inches will be full of the corpses
of blackbeetles and other drowned insects, and it is said
that birds occasionally visit these vases in order to pick
them out. There is probably some sort of secretion in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
water. "A centipede 1-2/3 inches long having fallen into a
vase of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sarracenia purpurea</i> in the night was found only
half-immersed in the water. The upper half of the creature
projected above the liquid, and made violent attempts to
escape; but the lower part had not only become motionless,
but had turned white from the effect of the surrounding
liquid; it appeared to be macerated, and exhibited alterations
which are not produced in so short a time in centipedes
immersed in ordinary rainwater."<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>In some Sarracenias the vase is brought up into a sort of
hood or dome with the entrance at one side and below.
There are thin patches on this dome or cupola, and small
insects, attracted by the light which comes through these
bare places, remain dashing themselves against them or
crawling over them just as flies do on a window-pane, until
they become tired and fall down into the water below.</p>

<p>There is something horrible in the cold and careful way
in which this plant arranges its baits for "confiding insects.
The latter are fed with honey, even on the very border of
the assassin's den, but after this farewell revel they generally
slip upon the smooth edge, and are hurled, like lost souls,
down into the abyss."<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>In another plant, the Pitcher Plant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nepenthes</i>, so
called from the drug which produces the sleep of death),
we find an even more beautifully arranged pitcher which
acts in very much the same way. It is, however, only the
end of a rather long leaf, or rather of its midrib, that is
turned up to act as a pitcher. There are similar stiff hairs
pointing downwards, and honey is plentifully secreted. But,
in Nepenthes, there is also a distinct secretion which digests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
the bodies of the drowning insects. The ferment resembles
the active principle of the gastric and pancreatic juices of the
human body, and, as acids are also present, the insect's body
becomes changed into nutritious juices which readily diffuse
into the plant.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Dr. Macfarlane found that when the
pitchers were stimulated by being given insects, the liquid
inside them could digest fibrin to jelly in from three-quarters
to one hour's time.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> But certain insects have somehow
managed to educate their larvæ to resist the gastric juices of
Nepenthes.</p>

<p>Near Fort Dauphin, in Madagascar, I found great quantities
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nepenthes madagascariensis</i>. Almost every pitcher was
one-third to two-thirds full of corpses, but in some of them
large, fat, white maggots, of a very unprepossessing appearance,
were quite alive and apparently thriving. These must
have been the larvæ of a blowfly similar to that which has
been mentioned by others as inhabiting Sarracenia. At the
same place a white spider was very often to be seen. Its
web was spun across the mouth of a pitcher, and its body
was quite invisible against the bleached remains inside.</p>

<p>It had suited its colour to the corpses within, in order that
it might steal from the Nepenthes the due reward of all its
ingenious contrivances!</p>

<p>A totally different arrangement is found in an inconspicuous
and ugly little marsh and ditch plant called Utricularia
or Bladderwort. It is very difficult to see, for unless
it happens to be in flower it is entirely submerged in the
water. The flowers, which are purple, are conspicuous and
easily seen even at a distance. On these submerged leaves
there are hundreds of small bladders. They are about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
size of a pea, and are most ingeniously contrived to catch
small water-animalcula. The general idea of the bladderwort
is exactly that of the eel-pots so common in some parts
of the Thames. There is a small flap which acts as a trapdoor.
Small creatures probably take refuge in the bladders
when pursued by the larger water-fleas, etc., for it must seem
to them to be a safe and secure retreat.</p>

<p>But once within the door, they are imprisoned and cannot
find their way out again. They perish inside and their
bodies are digested by the plant; on the inside of the bladder
there are gland hairs which also secrete a digestive fluid.</p>

<p>The bladderwort is dangerous to fish, for the little fry,
when quite small, run their heads and gills into the bladders
and are suffocated.</p>

<p>There are a great many kinds of Utricularia, and they
occur in most of the great floral regions.</p>

<p>One of them has chosen a very extraordinary and curious
situation. It lives inside the little cups of water which, as
we have already mentioned, are formed by the leaves of some
Bromeliads. The insects in the water which ought to
nourish the Bromeliad (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tillandsia</i>) are really used by the
Utricularia. Other Utricularias live in damp earth, moss, etc.</p>

<p>It is not only by traps and pitfalls that plants catch
insects: many have specially modified hairs which are quite
efficient insect-catchers.</p>

<p>Hairs are used by plants for many different purposes, and
it is rather interesting to see how quite a simple organ like
a hair can be altered. The stinging hair of the nettle has
already been mentioned; many grasses possess minute, rough,
flinty hairs, which probably prevent snails from eating them.
That also is probably the reason of the strong, rough, coarse
hairs which cover the Borage and the Comfrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Then on the Chickweed and the Bird's-eye Speedwell
there are lines of rather long, flexible hairs which at first
sight appear to be of no use at all. But if you take either
of these plants, and, holding it upright, place a large drop
of water on the leaves, you will see that these hairs are
intended to carry the water down the stem. The water runs
along them. It is a very pretty little experiment, especially
if done in artificial light, so that these hairs are, like the
root hairs, intended to absorb or suck up water as it passes
over them. Then the Edelweiss and the Lammie's Lug
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stachys lanata</i>) are entirely covered with white cotton-woolly
hairs: these are intended to keep the water in the plant,
and do so as effectually as a rough woollen coat will keep
out rain and mist. Silky hairs, downy hairs, and others are
found wrapping up the tiny baby leaves in the bud: they
probably keep them warm, and perplex and ward off objectionable
insects.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the sticky or glutinous hairs are the most
wonderful of all. They are found on many plants, such as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salvia glutinosa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Plumbago, and Catchfly. One can see
insects stuck on them and vainly struggling to be free, and
the hairs undoubtedly prevent green-fly and other such pests
from interfering with the honey of the flower. In some of
these cases it has been shown that the body of the insect is
actually used as food, but that is more obvious with two
interesting plants which specially devote themselves to the
capture of insect prey. One of these is very often kept in
the Boer farmhouses near Tulbagh, in South Africa, simply
to attract the flies, which are a perfect pest in those dry
valleys. Another Drosophyllum, the Fly-Catcher, grows on
sandy and rocky ground in Portugal and Morocco. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
also used by the peasants near Oporto as a convenient fly-paper.</p>

<p>In both of these plants large drops of a sticky, glistening
liquid are secreted by the hairs which cover the leaves.
Any small insect alighting on the latter is sure to get
covered by the liquid, and in trying to get away will become
hopelessly involved in it. It is probably soon suffocated, for
the gummy matter will choke the small air-holes by which it
breathes. Both these plants are said to secrete both an acid
and a digestive secretion.</p>

<p>But we have two plants which are even more interesting
in this country.</p>

<p>Walking over the rough marshy pastures or moors of
Scotland one is sure to notice, generally on wet peaty and
barren soil, a little rosette of bright, yellow-green, glistening
leaves. If it is the right season there will be a handsome
purple flower whose stalk springs from them. This is the
Butterwort (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinguicula</i>), and it is not a bad name, for the
leaves remind one of butter. The whole upper surface of
the leaves is covered with tiny glands secreting a sticky,
glistening matter. It is said that there will be as many as
fifty thousand of these glands on a square inch of the upper
surface.</p>

<p>Now in such places every one knows that there are
quantities of midges, and also that these insects are always
exceedingly thirsty. They prefer blood, it is true, but when
they see these bright yellowish leaves they naturally go to
them. When, however, the midge touches the leaf, the
sticky liquid clings to its wings and legs, and it cannot
escape.</p>

<p>So far this does not differ from the Fly Catchers mentioned
above, but another very curious action then begins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
If the midge or fly is near the margin of the leaf, the
edge of the latter begins to curl or roll inwards over it.
It does so very slowly, and may not finish rolling over the
insect for some hours. Whilst this is going on acids and
"gastric juice," or ferments which act in the same way, are
being poured over the body of the midge, which is finally
completely digested. Next day, having finished the midge,
the leaf majestically unrolls itself again and waits for
another.</p>

<p>The juice contains rennet, and is used by the Lapps in
making a horrible delicacy called Tätmiölk. It has also
been used by the Swiss shepherds for at least two hundred
years, to cure sores on cows' udders.</p>

<p>The other British plant is the Sundew (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Drosera</i>). Every
one who has been on peat-mosses and moors probably knows
its little reddish rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped
leaves lying on bare peat or wet mossy ground. Each leaf
seems to be covered by hundreds of glittering little dewdrops
(whence the name).</p>

<p>The hairs or tentacles which cover the leaf secrete this
glistening, sticky fluid. There must be about two hundred
of them on a single leaf.</p>

<p>An insect flying about near the Sundew is sure to be
attracted by the conspicuous glittering, reddish leaves, and
probably alights upon it. Then it finds itself caught and
begins to struggle, but this simply brings it against more
tentacles.</p>

<p>Now happens the most wonderful part of the whole performance.
All the neighbouring tentacles, although they
have not been touched, bend over towards the struggling
insect and pin it down in the middle of the leaf. They do
not bend over very quickly. In two or three minutes they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
will bend over towards it through an angle of forty-five
degrees, and it takes them ten minutes to bend over ninety
degrees.</p>

<p>There is something rather horrible in the sight of a large
insect struggling with these slow, remorseless, well-aimed
tentacles; most people free the insect unless, at least, it happens
to be a midge. The point which is so difficult to
understand is to know how those untouched tentacles know
that the insect is there and exactly where it is. There is no
doubt that they do know, for they behave exactly as if they
were the arms of a spider.</p>

<p>If you put two insects on either side of the middle of the
leaf, half the tentacles will pin down one and the other half
will deal with the other insect.</p>

<p>At the same time acids and ferments are poured out which
digest the insect. It takes about two days for a leaf to
finish off an insect, and then the tentacles again unclose.</p>

<p>Moreover it is difficult to deceive those tentacles. They
will bend in for the tiniest piece of useful substance; for
instance, a length of one-seventy-fifth of an inch of woman's
hair will make them secrete digestive fluid. One millionth
part of a pound of ammonium phosphate will also produce
secretion. But a shower of heavy rain, grains of sand, or
other useless material, will not cause any secretion, and even
if they do bend in a little, they soon discover their mistake
and stand out again. If you try the same experiment under
a bell-glass from which the oxygen has been withdrawn by an
air-pump, nothing happens; or if you chloroform the Sundew
it will pay no attention to small pieces of meat until it recovers
from the effects of the chloroform.</p>

<p>When these Droseras are taken to a greenhouse and experiments
are made on them, they run into very great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
danger. They are almost certain to die of overfeeding or
indigestion. It is impossible to keep people from giving
them too much to eat.</p>

<p>This wonderful little plant shows quite distinctly that
there must be some way of sending messages in its leaves.
Somehow the message travels from the tentacle which the fly
has touched, down the stalk into the leaf, and up into the
other tentacles, and tells them that there is something worth
stooping for.</p>

<p>No one has explained this, and probably no one will ever
do so.</p>

<p>The last, and in some ways the most interesting, of all
these carnivorous plants is Venus' Fly-trap (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dionæa muscipula</i>),
which grows in North America from Rhode Island
to Florida.</p>

<p>It is a quite small herb with a small circle of leaves which
lie flat on the ground. Each leaf ends in a nearly circular
piece which is divided by a very marked midrib. The two
semicircular halves have a series of teeth along their edges;
these margin teeth are stiff and a little bent upwards. In
the centre of each half there are three small hairs. On looking
closely at these hairs one finds that each has a joint near
the base; all over the centre of these leaf halves there are
scattered glands which secrete ferments intended to digest
any animal matter.</p>

<p>The really interesting point is connected with these central
jointed or trigger hairs; they are extremely sensitive. But
when they are touched it is not they themselves that are
affected, but the entire circular end of the leaf!</p>

<p>Suppose an insect wanders on to the leaf and reaches one
of these semicircular halves, nothing happens until it touches
one of these hairs, but then <em>both</em> halves suddenly close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
together, exactly like an ordinary rat-trap! The teeth on
the edges of the halves interlock like the teeth of a trap, and
the insect is caught and imprisoned.</p>

<p>Its body is slowly digested away and goes to nourish the
plant. The use of the joint in the sensitive hairs can be
easily perceived, for when the two halves shut up together,
the hairs fold down exactly like the funnel of a river steamboat
when it passes under a bridge.</p>

<p>The closing of the two halves, which has been well compared
to shutting up a half-open book, is very quick, as it
does not take more than ten to thirty seconds. There is an
abundant flow of "gastric juice," but the leaf takes a long time
to digest its food. It may require three weeks to finish one
insect. Moreover, if overfed, it may turn a bilious or dyspeptic
yellow colour, and wither or even die. It only shuts
for a short time if a grain of sand touches the sensitive hair,
and, like Drosera, is not deceived in its food.</p>

<p>The Dionæa, Drosera, the Sensitive Plant, Mimulus, Barberry,
and others, all show us clearly that plants somehow or
other act as if they were conscious of what they ought to do.
In fact, in all these cases, it is scarcely possible to help
believing in some sort of rudimentary nervous system. At
any rate Wordsworth comes near this belief, for he has
written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N Great Britain in this present year one finds exceedingly
few places where the influence of man cannot be traced.
Over most of the country, indeed, it is impossible to
discover a single acre of land where Nature has been allowed
to go on working at her own sweet will without interference
or restraint.</p>

<p>But near Stirling, between the Lake of Monteith and the
sea, there is a wide, desolate valley which is probably in
exactly the same condition as it was when the Roman
legions halted to reconnoitre before Agricola passed onwards
to Perth and Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Indeed, this great peat-moss has been probably in very
much the same condition for some 200,000 years, which is a
nice round number to represent the ages that have passed
since the Great Ice Age.</p>

<p>Now, as then, it is inexpressibly dreary and desolate;
everywhere saturated with water, and only to be traversed
in dry seasons and with much agility. Even with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
greatest care the pedestrian may sink to the waist in a hole
of black, slimy, peaty water. Moss, Heather clumps, Sedges,
Rushes, and occasionally Cotton-grass, almost at one dead
level, stretch right across from the one side of the huge valley
to the other.</p>

<p>Even grouse are not common. In summer great numbers
of gulls lay their eggs upon the moss. This also is one of
the few places in Britain where great flocks of wild geese can
be heard and seen, but only at a distance.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to get near them, for the upright
neck of the sentinel cannot be seen by the stalker as he
wriggles towards the flock on his face, until long after the
stalker himself has been plainly visible to the bird.</p>

<p>Of all useless stretches of barren waste, such a moss as this
seems one of the worst. It would, of course, be possible to
reclaim it; probably, fertile fields and rich meadows <em>could</em>
be formed over the whole valley, but it would not pay
nowadays. There is so much good land available in Canada,
the United States, and Australia, that this great stretch of
our native country will probably remain as useless as it was
in Agricola's days.</p>

<p>In the Scottish Lowlands and Highlands the moorlands
are almost as desolate. At a height of 1500 to 1600 feet
in Southern Scotland there is nothing to be seen but the
undulating lines of hills, all dark purple with heather or
with the peculiar scorched reddish green of Deer's Hair and
dried sedges.</p>

<p>Perhaps on the nearer hills small streams may have cut a
whole series of intersecting ravines in the black peat. They
may be six to ten feet deep, and here and there the bleached
white stones which underlie them are exposed. Now and
then the "kuk-kuk-kuk" of an irate cock grouse, and much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
too frequently the melancholy squawking of the curlew, irritates
the pedestrian as he stumbles over clumps of heather,
plunges in and out of the mossy holes, or circumvents impossible
peat-haggs.</p>

<div><a name="an_arctic_alpine_plant" id="an_arctic_alpine_plant"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p class="smcap">An Arctic Alpine Plant</p>
<p>This is Draba Alpina from Cape Tscheljuskin, and it is drawn the
natural size. The stunted, closely set leaves show the inclement character
of the climate.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is indeed a remarkable fact that though these islands
support 44,000,000 of inhabitants, including at least
1,000,000 paupers and unemployed, one-seventh of Ireland
and many square miles in Scotland are still useless peat-bogs!</p>

<p>The Bog of Allen alone covers 238,500 acres, and the peat
is twenty-five feet deep.</p>

<p>In some few places the peat is still used for fuel, and there
is a theory to the effect that peat reek is necessary for the
best kinds of Scotch whisky, but neither grouse nor black-faced
sheep, which live on the young shoots of the heather,
employ in at all a satisfactory way these great stretches of
land.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to spin the silky threads
of the Cotton-grass which grows abundantly on the Scotch
lowlands. It is neither a grass, nor does it supply cotton,
but is called Eriophorum. It is perhaps the one really
beautiful plant to be found on them, for its waving heads
of fine silky-white hairs are exceedingly pretty.</p>

<p>The heather itself gives a splendid red and purple shade,
which in summer and autumn is always changing colour, but
it is monotonous. Neither the little Bog Asphodel with its
yellowish flowers, nor red Drosera, or butter-coloured Butterwort,
are particularly beautiful.</p>

<p>After seeing such a country one understands something
of the Cameronian Covenanters who held their conventicles
and took refuge therein.</p>

<p>The manner in which these mosses and moors have developed
is most interesting, and yet difficult to explain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
There are two kinds of peat-mosses, which, although there
are many intermediate types, may be kept apart.</p>

<p>The first, like the one near Stirling, Lochar and Solway
Moss, near Dumfries, and Linwood, near Glasgow, have been
formed in low-lying flat estuarine marshes.</p>

<p>If one refers back to page <a href="#Page_210">210</a>, it will be seen how reeds
and rushes and marsh plants may gradually fill up river
backwaters. Eventually a saturated, marshy meadow is produced.</p>

<p>Then comes the chance of that wonderful moss the peat-moss,
or Sphagnum. It is scarcely possible to appreciate its
structure without the help of a microscope and a good deal
of trouble in the way of imagination.</p>

<p>It is in a small way a sort of vegetable pump which raises
water a few inches or so. Stem and leaves and branches
possess little cistern cells, which act both as capillary tubes
raising the water and also retain it. The stems are upright
and develop many branches, so that they become a close-ranked
or serried carpet of upright moss-stems squeezed
together, which floats on the surface of the water. Each
moss-stem is growing upwards and dying off below. In consequence,
the bottom gets filled up by dead mossy pieces,
which accumulate there, while the live moss-carpet remains
floating on the surface of the loathly, black, peaty water.</p>

<p>In many peat-mosses the water gets entirely filled up, but
that does not stop the formation of the peat-moss. It is
now resting on the water-saturated remains of its forefathers,
and if water is abundantly supplied it goes on developing.</p>

<p>Thus in these lowland or estuarine peat-mosses the moss
eventually occupies the water, and goes on growing. After
this it develops like the moorland mosses which cover most
of the Lowlands and Highlands of Scotland. They cover the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
hills, and it looks exactly as if some giant had plastered all
those hills with a layer of six to ten feet of black peat from
1250 feet upwards.</p>

<p>The soil would at first be covered by a saturated moss-carpet
of <i>Sphagnum</i> and other mosses. Rainwater falling
upon it was all retained, and very little could get away,
for the Sphagnum carpet is just like a huge sponge soaking
up and retaining the water.</p>

<p>But it sometimes happens in these great upland mosses
that there are enormous falls of rain which continue for days.
Then the water collects <em>under</em> the living moss-carpet and
over the dead peat. It may be gathered together in such
quantities that the carpet of living peat above it bursts, and
a deluge of peaty water overflows the surrounding country,
destroying and spoiling everything that it encounters.</p>

<p>The worst of these inundations of black mud that has
happened in recent years was in December, 1896, near
Rathmore, where 200 acres of bog burst and a horrible river
of mud overflowed the country for ten miles. Nine people
perished, and enormous destruction was caused.</p>

<p>There have been many other cases. In 1824 Crowhill
Bog, near Keighley, burst; and in 1745, in Lancashire, a
space a mile long and half a mile broad was covered by peaty
mud. There was also a case in 1697, where forty acres of
bog at Charleville burst in the same way.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Attempts have often been made to calculate the rate of
growth of such peat-mosses. A great many of them began
to develop on the mud left by the ice-sheet when the
glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age. Those mosses
are therefore probably 200,000 years old. Some of our
Scotch mosses are twenty to twenty-five feet in depth, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
gives a foot in 10,000 years. By calculation of the weight
of the peat formed, Aigner made out that a certain moss
was 20,600 years old, and was growing at the rate of two
inches in a century.</p>

<p>But in Denmark ten feet has been formed in 250 to 300
years, and in Switzerland three to four feet of peat-moss has
been formed in twenty-four years.</p>

<p>This shows quite distinctly that there is no regular rate of
growth, and indeed it is obvious that much must depend on
the climate, on the rainfall, on the drainage, and other
circumstances.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, however, a limit comes to the growth of
the moss. The surface then becomes gently curved: it is
highest in the centre, and slopes very gently down in every
direction to the edges.</p>

<p>What happens next? The first sign is that the surface
begins to dry up, and Heather, with grey Cladonia lichens,
begins to grow on the projecting tufts and tussocks.</p>

<p>Occasionally, if gulls build their nests on such drying-up
mosses, patches of bright green grass appear wherever the
gulls are in the habit of resting. That is due to the lime in
their guano.</p>

<p>But under quite natural conditions a much more important
and interesting change begins.</p>

<p>Here and there scattered over the moss, miserable little
seedling Birches and Scotch Firs begin to struggle for life.
Of course, if there are hares and rabbits, or if sheep and
cattle are allowed to graze upon the moss, those firs have no
chance whatever. They are eaten down to the ground.</p>

<div><a name="lake_dwellings_in_early_britain" id="lake_dwellings_in_early_britain"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_359.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="smcap">Lake Dwellings in Early Britain</p>
<p>The Irish elk is the result of the day's sport of these prehistoric Britons, who lived in houses
built on piles actually in the water, or in peat mosses. Their only boats were rough dug-out
canoes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But if allowed to go on growing they would no doubt
cover the whole moss with a wood of Birch and Scotch Fir.
In time that wood would by its roots and its formation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
fine leaf-mould so radically alter the ground that a forest of
Oaks might be possible.</p>

<p>It is in fact quite likely that most of our Highland and
Scotch hills were at one time covered by fine forests of
Scotch Fir, of which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Silva Caledonica</i> spoken of by
Tacitus was an example.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, evidence to show that this was the
case. There is one strange peculiarity of peat which renders
it a most useful substance to antiquarians.</p>

<p>Anything lost in a peat-moss does not decay away, but
remains in a blackened but still recognizable condition for
hundreds of years. Not long ago a basket containing the
bones of a child was found in a Scotch peat-moss. There is
also a story that an English trooper of the fourteenth or
fifteenth century, and his horse, were discovered in Lochar
Moss, near Dumfries. The man's features were traceable at
first, but fell into powder when exposed to the air; but the
weapons, stirrups, etc., were all perfectly preserved. Bones
of the extinct Irish elk have often been found. Not merely
so, but the piles of lake dwellings and the rough dug-out
canoes which were used by the early inhabitants of Britain
have been discovered in a great many places. Coins of
Roman, medieval, and modern times have been unearthed,
and indeed there is no doubt that if Britain is still inhabited
two thousand years hence, boots, sardine tins, brass cartridges,
clay pipes, and other characteristic products of our
own days, will be disentombed from the peat by enthusiastic
antiquarians, and displayed in museums to admiring crowds
of our descendants.</p>

<p>The reason is quite simple: in peat neither those bacteria
which cause ordinary decomposition, nor worms of any kind,
are able to exist, so that the material does not decay but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
accumulates, though it may be blackened by peat, water, and
humic acid. It is for this reason that a peat-moss is such a
bad or rather an impossible soil. Neither roots nor bacteria
can thrive in saturated peat; therefore the flora of a peat-moss
is generally confined to the upper surface, where air and
bacteria can reach the roots. Peat-mosses are also the home
of insectivorous plants, which get their nitrogenous food
from the insects which they catch.</p>

<p>In consequence of this preserving effect of peat, it is
possible to trace the entire history of a peat-moss from the
very beginning. Remains of the Dwarf Willow or Polar
Birch have been found in England, showing that those now
Arctic plants were then flourishing in Norfolk. These are
generally in the lowest layers of peat-mosses. Next follow
remains of the Birch and Aspen, which would be growing,
as they do in places to-day, on mossy soil where the peat was
still thin. Higher up in the peat one finds remains of
Scotch Fir, showing that at that time regular forests of Scotch
Fir existed, e.g. in Sutherlandshire and on Lochar Moss,
where they do not grow at present.</p>

<p>Some hold that the goats, black cattle, and ponies which
have been kept since the Roman occupation at any rate, are
responsible for the destruction of these forests. Others
hold that they were killed by a change of climate. But
they certainly existed.</p>

<p>Trunks of Scotch Fir have even been found in peat at
2400 feet in Yorkshire, and at heights in Scotland which are
above all the present plantations. About this time it seems
that the newer Stone Age men must have been in Switzerland
and Denmark, for their remains and characteristic weapons
occur in those countries at the same level in the mosses as
the Scotch Fir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Still higher in the peat comes the Bog Oak. With it
are in Denmark remains of the Bronze, Iron, and Roman
times.</p>

<p>In Denmark the uppermost layers of the peat contain
remains of Beech trees. As this last tree only entered the
country in the historic period, it is not found except in the
highest layers of all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have not yet obtained in our own
country the same evidence from the peat-bogs as to the
history of the flora of Britain. It is at least probable that
it was on very much the same lines.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to again cover our peat-mosses and
moorlands with forests of Conifers, Pines, Larches, and
Spruces? There can scarcely be any doubt about it: it
would be possible, and according to the best authorities it
would even pay to change all land which is not yielding
more than 7s. 6d. an acre into forests of Pines.</p>

<p>One of the curious facts about peat is that though a
peat-moss is one of the worst natural soils, yet broken-up
and dried peat is excellent for Rhododendrons, for Orchids
in stoves and greenhouses, and a great many other plants.</p>

<p>Peat consists of very much the same substances as those
that go to form leaf-mould. But the presence of humic
and other acids, and the saturation with water and consequently
the absence of worms, bacteria, and also of air,
make it impossible for plants to grow in a peat-moss.</p>

<p>Peat-moss due specially to the Cotton-grass rather than
the Sphagnum moss is imported in great quantity from
Holland, for use as litter for horses. We have in this
country plenty of peat quite good for this purpose, but
labour is too expensive for our home-grown peat to compete
with the produce of Dutch moors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
But that is by no means all the uses to which peat can be
put. It is interesting to mention a few of them.</p>

<p>1. Peat is used as fuel.</p>

<p>2. Growing Orchids, etc.</p>

<p>3. Litter for poultry, cattle, and horses.</p>

<p>4. Food for cattle, etc., is made by rubbing the peat into
small pieces and saturating with molasses.</p>

<p>5. Paper and a kind of felt can be made of peat.</p>

<p>6. Rugs and carpets can be made of peat-fibre.</p>

<p>7. String and twine.</p>

<p>8. Rough sacks and mats can be made of peat-fibre.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though all these things can be produced
out of peat-fibre, it has never paid to manufacture them,
and there are very few of the British peat-mosses nowadays
where peat is even cut for fuel.</p>

<p>It seems much more likely that the end of these peat-mosses
will be to become either agricultural land or forest.</p>

<p>Near Glasgow a large area of a useless peat-moss has been
reclaimed and made to yield excellent crops, by using the
refuse of the city. The disposal of such refuse used to be a
most troublesome and expensive process, but now it is turned
to good effect.</p>

<p>It was suggested a few years ago that peat, which is not
worth conveyance, should be burnt on the spot, and the
energy transmitted by wires.</p>

<p>That would be quite impossible, in at least four years out
of five, over most of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">M</span>AN has always taken a certain pleasure in giving
names to both plants and animals. It was, of
course, a necessity to do this, but it is probable that
people enjoyed the process as they do now.</p>

<p>At the present moment there must be at least 200,000
plants named and described by botanists. So that the
number of ecstatic moments enjoyed by humanity has been
undoubtedly increased.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the Arabs named a
great many plants, but for the most part those names are
quite lost. Most of the knowledge of the Egyptians and
Babylonians remained a close secret confined to their priestly
colleges or universities, and has entirely perished.</p>

<p>For centuries those fragments of the knowledge of Greece
and Egypt which were preserved seem to have been translated
and taught in Latin. Long after the Roman Empire had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
passed away, all knowledge, including that of medicine, of
botany, and of law, was imparted in Latin, which indeed was
supposed to be learnt by every educated person almost until
the present century.</p>

<p>Even now descriptions of new plants have to be given in
Latin, and the name must have a classical appearance. Of
course, nowadays, it would be much more convenient and
much more generally useful if every person learnt English,
German, French, and Japanese, but in this case of naming
plants, the Holy Roman Empire still exercises its sway over
the whole world.</p>

<p>Very often the names given to plants are of the most
extraordinary character. The Latin is curious and the
Greek remarkable, yet sometimes they are both pleasant to
the ear and have a pretty and poetical meaning.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poggeophyton</i>, on the other hand, for example, means the
plant discovered by Dr. Pogge, a German botanical explorer.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wormskioldia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zahlbrucknera</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Krascheninikowia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthosicyos</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chickrassia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orychophragmus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Warczewiczia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnophoriopsis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Krombholtzia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pseudorhachicallis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sczegleewia</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zschokkia</i>, are all names that sound harsh and look odd to
us. Yet most of them are just called after those who discovered
them, or their friends. In many of the smaller
microscopic plants the names are really much longer than
the plants themselves. Thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pseudocerataulus Kinkeri</i> is a
diatom which cannot possibly be seen without the use of a
microscope.</p>

<p>Names are and were given in the most extraordinary way.
Not merely great botanists, but Themistocles, Aristides,
Aristobulus, Virgil, and even Gyas and Clianthes, have plants
named after them.</p>

<p>Yet that is not inexcusable, if people had not sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
inventive power to do better. There was a naturalist who
quarrelled with the great French scientist Buffon. Therefore
he baptized as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buffonia</i> a group of ugly, unimportant
little plants which had an unpleasant smell. In other cases
people have named plants after their sweethearts or friends.</p>

<p>A British plant called Bartzia has a rather melancholy,
desolate appearance. It was named when the author had
just received the news of the death of his friend Dr. Bartsch.</p>

<p>One of the most usual complaints which one hears from
those who are beginning to study flowers is that the Latin
names are so difficult and hard to remember. But they are
not really more difficult than the common popular names,
and especially those of foreign plants. Cheirostemon, for
instance, which means stamens like a hand, is much easier to
speak and to remember than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macpalxochitlquahuitl</i>, which is
its soft, meandering, Spanish-American name. Asperula
(little rough one) is quite as good as Squinancywort, which
means a herb good for quinsy (it is moreover of no good in
quinsy). Perhaps, however, Woodruff (which is really "wood
rowel," from the resemblance of the leaves to an old-fashioned
spur), or Waldmeister (master of the woods), are
as good names as Asperula. Then Erigeron, which means
"soon growing old," is an excellent description of the faded
appearance of this little weed, for which the popular name is
Fleabane (it has no effect upon these creatures whatsoever).</p>

<p>How popular names came to be associated with particular
flowers is generally quite unknown. A fair number are called
from the diseases which they are supposed to cure. Lungwort,
however, was so called because the lichen Pulmonaria
has a resemblance to lungs. Then in course of time people
began to suppose it was a cure for diseases of the lungs,
which it is not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
The British Orchids are called Bee, Spider, Fly, and Hanging-man
Orchids, because of a fancied resemblance to their
namesakes. Dancing-girls (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantisia</i>) was so called from a
certain resemblance of the flower to a columbine. The true
Columbine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquilegia</i>) was so called because of a resemblance
which some one saw to a circle of little doves with wings
seated on a circular well.</p>

<p>The greatest objection to popular names, however, lies in
their being so indefinite. Entirely different plants are
known by the same name, and also in different parts of the
country totally different names are given to the same plant.
All such difficulties disappear if one takes the trouble to
learn the Latin names.</p>

<p>These also are often quite pretty. Luzula, Veronica (with
its pretty legend), Mimulus (the little monkey), Circæa
(Enchanter's Nightshade), Senecio (<em>the old man</em>, from its
woolly head of fruits), Nymphea, Naias, Carlina (<em>the old witch</em>),
and so on, are quite as pretty and as nice as Mugwort, Devil-in-a-bush,
Hairy Rock Cress, and the rest. One curious
result of the use of popular names is seen in the Biblical
names of plants. The Rose of Sharon seems most probably
to have been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus Tarzetta</i>, and not a rose at all. As
regards the lilies of the Field, Mr. Ridley has the following
remarks. The Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Shushan</i> was a generic name
given to a mixture of flowers, exactly as we now talk of
ferns, herbs, or grass. The Sermon on the Mount was
preached near the plain of Gennesaret, and there flourish
the Anemone (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anemone coronaria</i>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ranunculus asiaticus</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adonis aestivalis</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flammea</i>, which are exactly of the
same colour and follow each other in close succession. This
word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Shushan</i> is the original of the Christian name Susannah
or Susan. The Arabic name for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anemone coronaria</i> is Susan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
The Almond of the Bible is the common almond which is
wild in Syria and Palestine. "Aaron's rod that budded was
a branch of an almond tree; the bowls of the Golden
Candlestick were designed from the almond blossom. Even
at the present time English workmen call the glass drops for
ornamenting candlesticks almonds." The Apple of the Bible
was more probably an Apricot. The husks of the prodigal
son were probably the Locust-beans, sometimes called St.
John's bread, but it is quite probable that the "locusts"
eaten by St. John were the insects. At any rate, locusts are
regularly eaten in the East. The Locust Tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceratonia
siliqua</i>), or Algaroba or Carob, has large, dark-purple pods;
there is a pulpy material between the seeds which forms
a valuable cattle food. The seeds are said to have been the
original "carat" weight of jewellers.</p>

<p>The Spikenard (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nardostachys jatamansi</i>) belongs to the
natural order <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valerianaceæ</i>. It is a wild plant of Bhutan
found near Rangasnati, in India, and in ancient times it was
transported on camels by the regular caravan route to Syria,
Greece, and Rome. It was then worth about £3. 10s. per
lb. The essence is obtained from the roots, but one hundred
pounds of roots will furnish only half a pound of essence.
Now it has but little value.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The Tares sown amongst the wheat were probably the
seed of the Darnel. When growing, this grass is very like
wheat, and it would be quite possible to mistake one for
the other until the flowers and fruit are formed. Darnel is
one of the very few poisonous grasses. It is said that the
poison is produced by a fungus which is found in the grain.
When darnel seed is ground up with wheat the bread
becomes dangerous, for the poison produces severe headache,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
vertigo, and giddiness. Other authorities say that it causes
in man and rabbits eruptions, fits of trembling, and confusion
of sight. It seems not to affect horned cattle, swine,
and ducks.</p>

<p>As regards those plants which were specially beloved and
venerated by the Greeks, there is not very much to say.
Moly seems to have been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Allium moly</i>, one of the onion or
garlic family. It is not very remarkable in any way.
Amaranth was apparently the garden Love-lies-bleeding,
called in France Queue-de-Renard and Discipline-de-Religieuse.
The Asphodel which covered the Elysian fields
seems to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asphodelus ramosus</i>.
<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> This grows in quantities
in Apulia, and is said to afford good nourishment for
sheep.</p>

<p>The Myrtle, with which the Athenian magistrates and
victors in the Olympic games were crowned, is not really
a European plant, though it has a wide range from Asia
Minor to Afghanistan. It was sacred to Venus, and had
some importance as a medicinal plant and for perfumes. It
was even used in cookery and for making myrtle wine, which
last is said to be still prepared in some parts of Tuscany.</p>

<p>"Narcissus, son of the river Cephisus and of Liriope,
daughter of the Ocean, was a young man of great beauty
who scorned all the Nymphs of the country, and made to
die of languor Echo, because he would not respond to her
passion. But one day returning from the chase weary and
fatigued, he stopped at the side of a fountain to refresh
himself. There having seen his own face in the water, he
was so smitten with it and so greatly loved himself that he
died of grief. The Gods, touched by his death, changed him
into a Daffodil, according to the fable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Such is the account in M. l'Abbé Ladvocat's <cite>Dictionnaire
Historique-Portatif</cite>, Paris, 1760. Daffodil means appearing
early in the year. The number of races, varieties, and forms
of Daffodil, Jonquil, etc., has become innumerable; yet it is
doubtful if any are quite so graceful and absolutely charming
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus poeticus</i>, supposed to be the original of the
above legend.</p>

<p>The Acanthus leaf which was so much used in sculpture
seems to have been that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthus spinosus</i>. It can still
be traced in modern carving, though, of course, it is very
much altered and in a rather degenerate form.</p>

<p>It is often very difficult to say why certain plants have
received so much attention and veneration in ancient times.
In some cases it is clearly because they are poisonous, and
therefore become dreadful and awe-inspiring. Why, however,
should a twig of Rowan (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus Aucuparia</i>) be so often
placed above the door of a Highland cottage? In some way
it was supposed to keep off evil spirits, but there is no
special reason why it should have been chosen.</p>

<p>The "Bour Tree" or Elder (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sambucus</i>) has been the
centre of a whole series of extraordinary and remarkable
superstitions. Of the Ellhorn (Low Saxon), or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sambucus
nigra</i>, Arnkiel gives the following account: "Our forefathers
also held the Ellhorn holy, wherefore whosoever
need to hew it down must first make his request, 'Lady
Ellhorn, give me some of thy wood, and I will give thee
some of mine when it grows in the forest'&mdash;the which,
with bended knees, bare head, and folded arms, was ordinarily
done."</p>

<p>The flowers are an eye-wash and cosmetic, or they may be
taken as tea or used as a fomentation. The berries are used
for "elderberry wine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
A certain cure for rheumatism is to carry about a small
piece of elder cut after the fashion of a rude cross.</p>

<p>Evelyn speaking of it says: "If the medicinal properties
of the leaves, bark, berries, etc., were thoroughly known,
I cannot tell what our countrymen could ail for which he
might not fetch a remedy from every hedge, either for sickness
or wound."</p>

<p>The other species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sambucus ebulus</i>, or Danewort) has had
its name explained as follows by Sir J. E. Smith: "Our
ancestors evinced a just hatred of their brutal enemies the
Danes in supposing the nauseous, fetid, and noxious plant
before us to have sprung from their blood."</p>

<p>Of all these, however, the Mandrake (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandragora</i>) is
connected with the most extraordinary and remarkable
superstitions. The plant is distinctly poisonous, and has
peculiar divided roots which sometimes have a very rough
resemblance to the human body. It was supposed to be
alive, and to utter the most piercing shrieks when it was
pulled out of the ground. In those accounts, which are
based on that given by Josephus, it is the <em>person</em> who pulls
out the root, and not the plant, that shrieks, subsequently
rolls on the ground, and finally dies in torments. Therefore,
if you wish to pull up a mandrake, the correct course to
pursue is as follows: Tie a dog to the plant by its tail, and
then whip the dog. It will pull up the mandrake, and then
die in frightful agony!</p>

<p>This is the "insane root" of Macbeth, but its various uses,
real or pretended, are too numerous to explain in detail.</p>

<p>Thus it was used for the following purposes: as a poison,
an emetic, a narcotic like chloroform, in love-philtres and
love-charms, as well as to dispel demons, who cannot bear its
smell or its presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
There are many of these relics of medieval times which
are difficult to explain or to find a reason for.</p>

<p>Why, for instance, should old women always carry a sprig
of Southernwood to the kirk in their Bibles? The leaves
are, however, said to be disagreeable to insects. The
Lavender stalks usually placed in linen both keep away
insects and have a pleasant old-world scent.</p>

<p>A great many of the properties possessed by plants are of
the most extraordinary and unsuspected nature. The roots
of the Madder (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubia tinctorum</i>), for instance, when they are
eaten by swine or other animals, change the colour of their
bones, which become pink. This curious property has
actually been made useful, for physiologists have employed
madder in the study of the growth and development of
bone.</p>

<p>In India and other eastern countries one is often shocked
and surprised to find an apparently quite healthy native
expectorating blood in a most lavish manner.</p>

<p>But the native is only chewing Betel nuts, which have the
power of turning the saliva red. The fruit is that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Areca
Catechu</i>, a fine palm which is cultivated, for this purpose only,
in many parts of India and the East. The nuts are cut in
pieces and rolled up with a little lime in leaves of the Betel
pepper. It is said to turn the teeth red and sometimes to
produce intoxication; at any rate, people become slaves to
this disgusting habit, and they do not seem to be at all
injured by indulgence in it.</p>

<p>Another extraordinary plant is Henna (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lawsonia inermis</i>).
The Egyptian mummies are found to have the soles of the
feet, as well as the palms and finger-and toe-nails, dyed a
reddish-orange colour by the use of henna. But the practice is
continued to-day in most parts of the East, and no odalisque's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
toilet would be considered complete without the use of
henna. It is even said that men dye their beards with it.</p>

<p>The white horse used in processions by the Shah of Persia
has its legs, tail, and body dyed with henna.</p>

<p>The powdered leaves are used: they are made into a paste
with hot water, and then spread upon the place. It is grown
in Syria, Egypt, Algeria, China, Morocco, Nubia, Guinea,
and the East Indies.</p>

<p>In China women dye their eyebrows with an extract of the
petals of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hibiscus Rosa-sinensis</i>.</p>

<p>One of the first plants to be utilized by man was the
Castor-oil (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ricinus communis</i>). It was used by the Indians
from time immemorial; it is mentioned by Herodotus (under
the name Kiki); seeds have been found in mummy-cases,
showing the careful preparations which were made for the
dead when starting on their travels in the other world!</p>

<p>It is one of the very commonest plants in the tropics and
in sub-tropical or warm, temperate countries. It is rather
handsome, and has large reddish-green leaves and handsome
spikes of flowers. It is said to be sometimes twelve feet
high, but is usually only six or seven feet. The seeds are
mottled or marbled, and have a distinct resemblance to a
beetle when seen from above. It has been suggested that
this protects them from birds, or enables the latter to
recognize the seed, which is strongly medicinal. That, however,
is at least doubtful, and certainly pigeons are exceedingly
fond of the seeds and eat them in quantity. The oil
is used for lighting, in making soap, and also in painting.</p>

<p>Another characteristic Egyptian plant was the Leek, which
with the onion and garlic seems to have been one of the
very first to be brought into cultivation. Herodotus says
that on the Great Pyramid there was an inscription saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
that 1600 talents had been paid for onions, radishes, and
garlic used by the workmen during its erection.</p>

<p>The Jewish priests were forbidden to eat garlic, which
(with cucumber) formed the dishes most regretted by the
Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness. The
Shallot comes from Ascalon, where it will be remembered
Richard the First defeated Saladin the Sultan, and where
also Sir Sidney Smith defeated the Emperor Napoleon and
made him miss his destiny. It was not brought to this
country till 1548. Probably, therefore, Tennyson's Lady
of Shalott lived somewhere else. Onions and leeks are of
course popular in this country, and especially in Wales,
where the latter has been the badge of the Welsh since they
gained a victory over the Saxons in the sixth century.
They wore it as a badge on that occasion by an order of
St. David.</p>

<p>But in warmer countries onions and garlic are much more
important, where they have flavoured almost every dish since
the days of Nestor's banquet to Machaon in Asia, and of the
Emperor Nero in Italy, until our own days.</p>

<p>But the subject is so inexhaustible, depending as it does
upon man's powers of invention and his tendency to weird
superstitions, that we must close this chapter and also the
book.</p>

<p>And we will end by asking the reader to think sometimes
of all these many and various ways in which plants help and
interest man.</p>

<p>It is not merely because our life depends upon them.
Everything that we eat has been produced by plant life and
plant work.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee, cocoa, and wine are pleasant because plants
have produced some essence which is found useful and agreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
by mankind. Even water would be tasteless and unwholesome
were it not for the minute diatoms and other
microscopic vegetables in it.</p>

<p>But those who take an interest in flowers and leaves <em>for
themselves</em>, find that they need never spend a dull hour in
the country. There is so much to see and to find out, even
in the commonest weed or the tiniest floweret.</p>

<p>But it is necessary to sympathize with them, to try to
look at things from their point of view, and not merely from
an artistic or collector's standpoint.</p>

<p>The romance of plant life then becomes a fascinating and
engrossing pursuit. But however long one studies it, the
knowledge that the wisest naturalist can ever attain to must
remain a negligible quantity compared with what he does
not know.</p>

<p>Suppose a mouse happened to stray into the office of the
editor of the <i>Times</i>, he might boast to his fellow-mice of
his knowledge of the "higher journalism," but his opinions
would not really be of very great value on the subject.</p>

<p>However hard we study, and however much we observe and
reflect upon the working of this great world of Nature, we
really cannot expect to know more relatively than that little
mouse.</p>

<p>In fact, the more we think, the more humble men of heart
we become, and the greater also should be our reverence for
the Creator of this wonderful universe.</p>

The gas Carbonic acid consists of one part of Carbon and two of
Oxygen. It is invisible, just as are the gaseous states of many liquids
and solids. Water-vapour is not visible, though water (liquid) and ice
can of course be seen. Starch, sugar, cell wall substance, etc., all contain
Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Vegetable fat is not well understood,
but starch helps to form it.</p>

always burning, and were put to death if they misbehaved. The fire was

The pollen from the great pine forests of the Italian Alps blown up
to the snow becomes used in nourishing the Pink or Red Snow Algæ,
which colours it a delicate rose-pink. In lower grounds all such pollen
becomes, like leaf-mould, a manure for other plants. There is no <em>waste</em>,
strictly speaking.</p>
